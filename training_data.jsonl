{"instruction": "Explain the following definition.", "input": "", "output": "A mathematical statement, also known as a proposition, is a declarative sentence (or string of sentences) that can be definitively classified as either true or false, meaning it possesses a determinable truth value. Examples 1.1.1. • 1 + 1 = 2 This is a True proposition. 2\n\n • If n is a nonnegative integer then n2 + n + 41 is a prime number. This is a False proposition. The first counterexample occurs at n = 40. • There are infinitely many prime numbers of the form 2n −1, where n is an integer. It is not known whether this is True or False, but it is still a valid proposition. It has a truth value, even if we have not determined which one yet. Non-Examples 1.1.2. • x2 ≥8 By itself this is not a proposition. Without knowing what x represents, we cannot verify whether the statement is True or False. Later we will see that this is an example of what we call a variable proposition (also known as an open sentence or predicate in logic). • 1+ = 2 This is a nonsensical string of symbols and has no meaning. • This statement is false. Although this is a declarative sentence, it does not have a truth value. If the statement were True then it would also be False, and if it were False then it would also be True. Our definition of a mathematical statement excludes paradoxes like this. (A course devoted specifically to symbolic logic would offer a more formal definition of a mathematical statement, but this explanation is sufficient for our purposes.) Special Names for Proven Statements When reading a mathematics textbook or paper, you might encounter established results labeled as theorem, corollary, lemma, or simply proposition. These labels help convey the role and importance of a given result. • Theorem: An important result. • Corollary: A result that follows from a theorem with little extra work. For instance, applying a general theorem to a special case. • Lemma: A smaller result that is useful in proving more significant results later. • Proposition: A general term that can apply to any result. It is often used for results that are not substantial enough to be called theorems. 3\n\n 1.1.2. Formal Definitions In mathematics, a definition fixes the exact meaning of a term so that everyone is using it consistently. These definitions often arise from recurring mathematical concepts. For example, consider the following definition of an isosceles triangle.", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}
{"instruction": "Explain the following definition.", "input": "", "output": "A triangle is called isosceles if and only if two of its sides have equal length. A few things to note here. • The phrase “if and only if” is often abbreviated as “iff”. It indicates that the statement is biconditional: any triangle called “isosceles” has two sides of equal length, and any triangle with two sides of equal length is classified as “isosceles”. All definitions are biconditional, even if the author phrases them differently. • Definitions must be unambiguous. We may not infer anything about the term other than what is stated in the definition. Given the definition above, any triangle with either two or three sides of equal length satisfies the definition of being “isosceles”. If the intention were to describe only triangles with exactly two sides of equal length, that restriction would need to be explicitly stated. • We may need to appeal to other formal definitions to fully understand this one. For instance, what is a “triangle”, a “side” of a triangle, or the “length” of a side? You may think of definitions as abbreviations for much longer mathematical statements or concepts. For example, it is easier to say “isosceles triangle” than “a polygon with exactly three sides in which at least two of them are equal in length”, especially if the concept comes up frequently. Formal definitions play a crucial role in crafting rigorous mathematical proofs. Relying on precise definitions is essential for moving from vague, intuitive reasoning to mathematically correct and formally articulated arguments. 1.1.3. Proofs In your previous math courses, you have likely encountered proofs for different theorems. But what exactly is a proof? How do we determine the truth of a proposition? Unlike in law, where terms such as “preponderance of evidence” and “beyond a reasonable doubt” are used, mathematicians do not rely on weight of evidence. Instead, we seek certainty. Consider the following example. Proposition: For any positive integer n, the greatest common divisor of n17 + 9 and (n + 1)17 + 9 is 1. You could have a computer plug in values for n for a lifetime and never find a counterexample. You might then begin to suspect that the proposition is true. Such a statement is called a conjecture, meaning a claim believed to be true but not yet proven. However, 4\n\n in this case the conjecture is false. The first counterexample occurs at n = 8424432925592889329288197322308900672459420460792433 If a proposition is true, we clearly need more than computational checks.

{"instruction": "Explain the following definition.", "input": "", "output": "A proof is a logical argument that establishes the truth of a mathematical statement beyond any doubt. Important Criteria for Proofs • Precision: Every statement should be true and unambiguous. • Logic: Each step must follow from previous steps with proper motivation and explanation. • Organization: The argument should proceed in a clear order, starting from assumptions and ending with the desired result. • Clarity: Steps should be connected with enough explanation for the reader to follow. Write your proofs with the audience of a typical student in this course in mind, including enough detail for them to understand. It will take time to grow comfortable with writing proofs. Look at examples in the lecture notes and textbook to see how proofs are typically structured. Practice by working on worksheet problems and unassigned exercises before consulting solutions. Re-read your own proofs and make revisions. Pay close attention to feedback you receive. Later, when we reach the logic section, we will begin studying proof-writing strategies based on the structure of statements. First, however, we will need to establish some of the basic vocabulary related to sets and logic. 1.2. Exploring Statements and Proofs Exercise 1.2.1.

Subtracting m from both sides we get n = 2a + 2b −m = 2a + 2b −2a = 2b Therefore we have shown n is even. (a) Is this theorem true? (b) Is the proof valid and well written? Explain your reasoning. (c) If your answer to (a) is yes and (b) is no, try to fix the proof. What are the basic assumptions of this proposition?

The second father asked, “How old are you? We must be around the same age.” The first father, a mathematician, replied cryptically: “Our ages sum to 72, I am six times as old as my son, and when I am twice his age later in life, our combined ages will double our current total.” Set up a system of equations based on this information and determine the ages of the three family members. Exercise 1.2.5.

Basic Set Theory A set is a foundational concept in mathematics, and much of mathematics can be expressed in terms of set theory. In formal set theory, a set is treated as an undefined primitive, with its properties and behavior described by axioms. This level of rigor goes beyond the scope of this course. Instead, we will adopt a naive, intuitive understanding of sets that is sufficient for our purposes.", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}
{"instruction": "Explain the following definition.", "input": "", "output": "A set is a well-defined collection of objects, considered as a single object in its own right. The objects in a set are called elements (or members). A set is well-defined if, given any object, we can unambiguously decide whether it belongs to the set. For example, we may define P as the set of all prime numbers, or S as the set of all students currently enrolled in 21-127. Notation. We commonly use capital letters to denote sets and lowercase letters to denote elements of sets. We write x ∈X to indicate that “x is an element of X,” and x /∈X to indicate that “x is not an element of X.” 2.1.1. How to Define a Set In mathematics, defining a set using a description, such as “Let P be the set of prime numbers,” can sometimes be acceptable for informal discussions. However, such definitions are often unclear or ambiguous and can lead to misunderstandings or inaccuracies. Precise and unambiguous definitions are crucial for rigorous mathematical reasoning and proofs. To avoid these issues, mathematicians use formal methods to define sets. Two common methods are roster notation and set-builder notation. Roster Notation Roster notation lists all the elements of a set explicitly. For example, the set of the first five prime numbers can be written as P = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11}. This method is straightforward 9\n\n but only practical for sets with a small number of elements. When dealing with sets that have a clear and recognizable pattern, we may sometimes use an informal “implied list” notation with ellipses, such as E = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, . . .} In these cases, it is important to include a clarifying setence to specify the pattern: “Here E represents the set of nonnegative, even integers.” Although this method is informal, it sometimes can be the easiest way to convey the idea to the reader. Set-Builder Notation Set-Builder Notation provides a more flexible and precise way to define sets, especially those with infinitely many elements. It describes the properties that characterize the elements of the set. For instance, we can define P(x) to be the predicate “x2 ≥8”. As we discussed before, this is not a proposition because x is not defined, but when a real number is substituted for x, it becomes a proposition. If P(x) is a predicate, then the set S of all elements x from a larger set A which satisfy P(x) is denoted as S = {x ∈A | P(x)} or S = {x ∈A : P(x)} On the left side of the vertical line (or colon), we indicate which set our elements are coming from, and on the right side of the vertical line, we indicate which properties must hold of them.", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

{"instruction": "Explain the following definition.", "input": "", "output": "An atomic proposition (or atom) is a proposition whose truth value is independent of the truth value of any other proposition. In particular, an atomic proposition cannot be broken down into simpler propositions. In propositional logic, we use propositional variables such as P, Q, R, etc., to denote atomic propositions. We can think of these in the same way we think of variables in algebra; any proposition may be substituted for these propositional variables. For example, we may define the atomic propositions P and Q as: P := “It will rain today.” Q := “Every prime number greater than 2 is odd.” From here, we will build compound statements using logical connectives. The logical connectives for propositional logic are: ∧, ∨, ¬, →, ↔ With these, we can create more complicated propositions such as the following: ¬(P →(¬Q ∧R)) We will define each of these logical connectives one at a time. To aid in this process, we will use a truth table. A truth table is a table used to describe the truth value of a compound proposition under all possible truth values of the atomic propositions within it. If n different atomic propositions appear in the compound statement, then the truth table requires 2n rows. Truth tables are useful for defining logical connectives and proving logical equivalences of various propositions. We now proceed to define each of our connectives. Conjunction Any two propositions can be combined to form a new proposition called the conjunction of the original propositions. A conjunction is translated as “and” and is denoted with the ∧symbol. For propositions P and Q, we define the truth value of the compound proposition P ∧Q as: P ∧Q is true if and only if both P and Q are true. We can summarize this with a truth table: 21\n\n P Q P ∧Q T T T T F F F T F F F F Disjunction We can also combine two propositions to form a new proposition called the disjunction of the original propositions. A disjunction is translated as “or” and is denoted with the ∨symbol. For propositions P and Q, we define the truth value of the compound proposition P ∨Q as: P ∨Q is true if and only if either P is true or Q is true or both. Again, we summarize this with a truth table: P Q P ∨Q T T T T F T F T T F F F Negation Given a single proposition, we can form a new proposition called its logical negation. A negation is translated as “not” and denoted ¬. If P is a proposition, then we define the truth value of ¬P as: ¬P is true if and only if P is false. We present this as a truth table below: P ¬P T F F T Logical Implication Given two propositions P and Q, we can form the compound proposition “if P then Q”, denoted P →Q, known as an implication. We define P →Q to be true unless P is true and Q is false. This is best presented as a truth table: 22\n\n P Q P →Q T T T T F F F T T F F T This is the hardest to understand of the logical connectives but also the most important. To understand the truth table above, it is helpful to view implication as an obligation or contract. For example, suppose the professor were to say: “If you get 100% on the final exam, then you will get an A for the course.” Under what conditions would this statement be false? That is, what would need to happen for the professor to be considered a liar? Hopefully, we can see that the above statement would be a lie only if a student received 100% on the final exam but the professor did not give them an A for the course. Caution: Do not mistake logical implication for causality. While we often read P →Q as “P implies Q” in logic, it does not mean that Q can be deduced from P, as we typically mean when we write proofs. There are many logical implications that are true but are not useful and would not be used in ordinary English. For example, the following proposition is always true: If you are a student at Carnegie Mellon University, then 2 is a prime number. Both P and Q are true, making P →Q true, but there is no causality. Even if you are not a student at Carnegie Mellon University and are reading this statement, it is still true. This brings us to another important point about implications: anytime P is false, P →Q is true. It is often said that a false proposition implies any proposition. There is a famous interaction between logician Bertrand Russell and one of his students when first presented with this idea: Student: “In that case, given that 1 = 0, prove that you are the Pope.” Russell: “Add 1 to both sides of the equation: then we have 2 = 1. The set containing just me and the Pope has 2 members. But 2 = 1, so it has only 1 member; therefore, I am the Pope.” Note that the statement “If 1 = 0, then I am the pope.” would be true regardless of who said it, even the pope.

{"instruction": "Explain the following definition.", "input": "", "output": "Let S and T be sets. • If R ⊆S ×T, then R is called a binary relation between S and T. If (a, b) ∈R, we say that “a is in relation to b,” sometimes denoted aRb. • S is called the domain of R, and T is called the codomain of R. Many of the common relations in mathematics (and in other contexts) are relations where both elements belong to the same set (i.e., S = T). In that case, we simply say that R is a relation on S, meaning that R ⊆S × S. We begin by examining examples of binary relations, some linking elements of different sets, and others connecting elements of the same set. Examples 14.1.1. 1. Let S be the set of students at CMU and T be the set of professors at CMU. We define a relation R ⊆S × T such that (s, t) ∈R if and only if s has taken a class with t. That is, R = {(s, t) ∈S × T | s has taken a class with t}. For any given pair (s, t) of student and professor, we can determine whether s has taken a class with t by checking if (s, t) ∈R. 89\n\n 2. The standard ordering relation < is a relation on sets such as R, Q, Z, and N. We can express this comparison as a set of ordered pairs. For instance, for x, y ∈R, we have x < y iff (x, y) ∈{(a, b) ∈R2 | ∃c ∈R+, (a + c = b)}. 3. The divisibility relation on the integers is another common example. Recall that for m, n ∈Z, we say that m | n if and only if there exists k ∈Z such that m·k = n. This relation can be viewed as the set of ordered pairs Rd: Rd = {(m, n) ∈Z2 | ∃k ∈Z, (m · k = n)}. 4. The subset relation ⊆is another familiar example. Let S be a set. We define the binary relation of ⊆on P(S) (the power set of S) such that for any A, B ∈P(S), the following holds: A ⊆B iff ∀x ∈S, (x ∈A →x ∈B). We can also express this relation as the set of ordered pairs, Rs: Rs = {(A, B) ∈P(S) × P(S) | ∀x ∈S, (x ∈A →x ∈B)}. 5. Functions are another important type of binary relation. For instance, the function f(x) = x2, defined for x ∈R, is a relation that links elements of R with other elements of R. The function f can be represented as the set of ordered pairs in R2 that satisfy the condition y = x2. In other words, the function f is given by: f = {(x, y) ∈R2 | y = x2}. This set is commonly referred to as the graph of f. 6. Equality is perhaps the most common binary relation on any set.

We define the identity function on S, denoted IdS or simply Id if the domain is clear from context, by IdS : S →S such that for all x ∈S, IdS(x) = x. That is, the identity function maps each element to itself. Equivalently, we can write IdS as the set of ordered pairs: IdS = {(x, x) | x ∈S}. 2. Define the function f : R+ →R by f(x) = √x for any x ∈R+. Then f is a function and can be expressed formally as: f = {(a, b) ∈R+ × R | a = b2 ∧b > 0}. 3. Let A = {x, y, z}. Define g : A →N by: g = {(x, 1), (y, 10), (z, 42)}. Note that there is no requirement for a specific pattern in the mapping, even if the domain is infinite. We do not need to explicitly write a rule defining the mapping for it to be a function. We simply need to ensure that for each a ∈A, there is a unique b ∈B such that (a, b) ∈g. 91\n\n Non-Examples 14.2.2. The following proposed “functions” are ill-defined: 1. Suppose you define a mapping f : R →R by f(x) = 1 x. f is not defined over the entire domain. In particular, f(0) is undefined. 2. Suppose you define a mapping g : N →N by g(n) = √n. While g(n) is defined for each n ∈N, the output does not always belong to the codomain N. For example, g(2) = √ 2 /∈N. 3. Suppose you define a mapping h : Q →Z by h \u0010 p q \u0011 = p + q. h is not well-defined because it fails to satisfy the uniqueness condition. For instance, 1 2 = 2 4, but h \u0000 1 2 \u0001 = 3 while h \u0000 2 4 \u0001 = 6. 92\n\n 15. September 29 15.1. Functions As seen in the previous non-examples, we can be given a rule for a mapping f : A →B, and it may not be clear whether or not it is a function. For this reason, we introduce the terminology of a well-defined function. A well-defined function is simply a binary relation that satisfies the definition of a function. However, it is worth emphasizing this point, as we are often given “rules” for mappings rather than explicit sets of ordered pairs.", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

Equivalence Relations In previous math courses, you may have encountered situations where objects that are distinct in one context are considered equivalent in another. For example, angles such as 0◦, 360◦, and 720◦differ numerically, but they represent the same direction when drawn on a circle. Similarly, in geometry, two similar triangles are often treated as equivalent because they share the same angles, even if their side lengths differ.

Our goal is to show that A ⊆C. We start by taking an arbitrary element a ∈A. Since we are given that A ⊆B, by the definition of a subset, every element of A is also an element of B. Therefore, we have a ∈B. Next, we use the fact that B ⊆C. By the definition of a subset, every element of B is also an element of C. Since we have already established that a ∈B, it follows that a ∈C. Since a was chosen arbitrarily from A, this reasoning applies to all elements of A. Thus, every element of A is also an element of C, which means A ⊆C by definition of a subset. Therefore, we have shown that if A ⊆B and B ⊆C, then A ⊆C. 11\n\n Notation. · A ̸⊆B means “A is not a subset of B”.

Number Sets Several sets of numbers are so commonly referred to that they get fixed notation. For now, several properties of these sets from elementary algebra will be taken for granted. The Natural Numbers N is used to denote the set of natural numbers. That is, N = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, . . .} N is defined to be the smallest set containing 0 and closed under the successor function (the +1 function). Informally, the natural numbers are the points on a number line that 12\n\n can be obtained by starting at 0 and moving right by a unit of length any number of times. (Our standard counting numbers.) Properties of N we may assume: • There is no largest natural number. • 0 is the smallest natural number. • The sum of two natural numbers is a natural number. • The product of two natural numbers is a natural number. The Integers Z is used to denote the set of all integers. That is, Z = {. . . , −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, . . .} The integers are the set of natural numbers along with their additive inverses (their negatives). We can think of Z as the set of points on a number line that can be obtained by moving either left or right by a unit length at a time. (Later, we will formally construct this set from N.) Note. We will often use Z+ to denote the set of positive integers. That is, Z+ = {1, 2, 3, 4, . . .} Properties of Z we may assume: • There is neither a largest nor a smallest integer. • The sum, difference, or product of two integers is an integer. 13\n\n We will explore the properties of the integers in more depth in the number theory section of the course, but we will discuss a few basic properties here. Definition (Integer Divisibility). For a, b ∈Z, we say that a divides b, denoted a | b, if and only if there exists an integer c such that b = ac. Example 2.1.5. · 2 | 6 because 6 = 2 · 3. · 3 ∤7 because 7 ̸= 3c for any c ∈Z. · 0 | 0 because 0 = 0 · k for any integer k. · 2 | 0 because 0 = 2 · 0. From the definition of the integer divisibility, we can prove properties of this relation. Theorem 2.1.6 (Transitivity of Divisibility). For any a, b, c ∈Z, if a | b and b | c then a | c. Proof. Assume that a, b, c ∈Z such that a | b and b | c. Then, by definition of integer divisibility, there exists m, n ∈Z such that b = ma and c = nb. We then have the following chain of equalities, using the associativity of multiplication. c = nb = n(ma) = (nm)a Since nm ∈Z, it follows that a | c. Exercise 2.1.7. Write the following sets out in formal set-builder notation. (a) A is the set of integers that can be expressed as the difference of two perfect squares. (b) B = {1, 8, 27, 64, . . .} (Assume the pattern continues indefinitely.) (c) C is the set of all positive divisors of 36. Exercise 2.1.8. Determine if the following statements are True or False. Justify your answer. (a) 0 | 5 (b) 5 | 0 (c) For a, b ∈Z, if a | b then a ≤b. (d) For a, b ∈N, if a | b then a ≤b. 14\n\n (e) The remainder, r, when an integer a is divided by a nonzero integer b is always nonnegative. Exercise 2.1.9.

Number Sets The Integers continued Using integer divisibility, we define what it means for an integer to be even or odd. Definition (Even/Odd). An integer n is called even if and only if 2 | n. An integer n is called odd if and only if n is not even, i.e., 2 ∤n. Note. By our definition, every integer is either even or odd, but not both. The following theorem formalizes our basic idea of “division with remainder” from grade school. We will state it without proof for now, but we will prove it in the next couple of weeks, and we will use this theorem heavily in the number theory section. Theorem 3.1.1 (Division Algorithm). Let a, b ∈Z with b ̸= 0. Then there exist unique integers q and r such that a = bq + r with 0 ≤r < |b|. Here, q is called the quotient and r is referred to as the remainder. For example, if a = 44 and b = 7, the only way to write 44 = 7q + r with 0 ≤r < 7 is 44 = 7 · 6 + 2 If a = −44 and b = 7, the only way to write −44 = 7q + r with 0 ≤r < 7 is −44 = 7 · (−7) + 5 And if a = 44 and b = −7, the only way to write 44 = (−7)q + r with 0 ≤r < 7 is 44 = (−7) · (−6) + 2 16\n\n Corollary 3.1.2 (Equivalent Definition of Even/Odd). For any n ∈Z: • n is even if and only if n = 2m for some m ∈Z. • n is odd if and only if n = 2m + 1 for some m ∈Z. Exercise 3.1.3. For each pair (a, b), find the unique integers q (quotient) and r (remainder) guaranteed by the Division Algorithm. (a) a = 17, b = 5 (b) a = −17, b = 5 (c) a = 84, b = −12 (d) a = 7, b = 9 Exercise 3.1.4. Prove the following statement: For any a, b, c ∈Z, if a | b and a | c, then a | (b + c). Scaffolding: Let a, b, c ∈Z be arbitrary and fixed integers such that a | b and a | c. • Write down the formal definition of a | b. • Write down the formal definition of a | c. • Add the two equations from Step 1 and Step 2 together. • Factor the resulting sum on the right-hand side. • Explain why the result of Step 4 satisfies the definition of a | (b + c). The Rational Numbers Q is used to denote the “set of all rational numbers”. That is Q = na b | a, b ∈Z and b ̸= 0 o On a number line, Q represents the set of points obtained by dividing any unit segment into an equal number of parts. For example, dividing each unit into 3 equal parts gives a subset of the rational numbers, as illustrated below. Recall that addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of rational numbers are defined in terms of addition and multiplication of integers: a b + c d = ad + bc bd and a b · c d = ac bd 17\n\n Thus, many properties of the rational numbers can be derived from our assumed properties of the integers. Proposition 3.1.5. The following properties hold for rational numbers: 1. The sum (or difference) of two rational numbers is a rational number. 2. The product of two rational numbers is a rational number. 3. The quotient of two rational numbers, where the divisor is nonzero, is a rational number. We will prove property 1 below. The other properties follow similarly and are left as exercises for the reader. Proof. Let x, y ∈Q. By definition of the rational numbers, there exist integers a, b, c, d ∈ Z with b, d ̸= 0 such that x = a b and y = c d. Then, x + y = a b + c d = ad + bc bd Since ad + bc ∈Z and bd ∈Z with bd ̸= 0, we conclude that x + y ∈Q. Note. In addition to these properties, you may also assume that there is neither a largest nor a smallest rational number. The Real Numbers R denotes the set of real numbers. This set includes all the rational numbers Q, as well as all irrational numbers. In other words, R is the completion of the rationals, filling in all the ”holes” on the number line. Properties of R we may assume: • There is neither a largest nor a smallest real number. • The sum, difference, and product of two real numbers are real numbers. • A real number divided by a nonzero real number is still a real number. • The product of two nonzero real numbers is nonzero. 18\n\n Recall that intervals of real numbers are subsets of R satisfying specific inequalities, as denoted below using set-builder notation. Assume a, b ∈R with a < b: (a, b) = {x ∈R | a < x < b} (a, b] = {x ∈R | a < x ≤b} [a, b) = {x ∈R | a ≤x < b} [a, b] = {x ∈R | a ≤x ≤b} (−∞, b) = {x ∈R | x < b} (−∞, b] = {x ∈R | x ≤b} (a, ∞) = {x ∈R | a < x} [a, ∞) = {x ∈R | a ≤x} Another important subset of the reals to define is the set of irrational numbers. These are real numbers that cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers. Examples include √ 2 and π. Formally, the set of irrational numbers is: {irrational numbers} = {x ∈R | x /∈Q} The Empty Set ∅denotes the empty set, which is the unique set with no elements. Formally, we write: ∅= { } The First n-many Positive Integers For any natural number n ∈N, we use the notation [n] to denote the set of the first n positive integers. Specifically: [n] = {m ∈N | 1 ≤m ≤n} For example: [0] = ∅ [1] = {1} [2] = {1, 2} [3] = {1, 2, 3} ... Note. The notation [n] is used to refer to the set of the first n positive integers, where [0] is the empty set, and [n] for n ≥1 includes all positive integers up to n.

Why or why not? Exercise 3.1.7. (a) Provide an example of a rational number q and an irrational number x such that qx is irrational. (b) Provide an example of a rational number q and an irrational number x such that qx is rational. 3.2. Logic We are in the process of learning a new language. We start with the basic words and terminology to make precise, unambiguous mathematical statements and study the structure of propositions. Understanding the structure of propositions will help us determine how to prove or disprove statements. 3.2.1. Propositional Logic The most elementary logic we can study is called propositional logic. In propositional logic, we examine the logical relationships between various mathematical statements based on their sentence structure. To study the structure of propositions, we must have a starting point–our atoms for propositional logic. 20", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

Therefore, we have a ∈B. Next, we use the fact that B ⊆C. By the definition of a subset, every element of B is also an element of C. Since we have already established that a ∈B, it follows that a ∈C. Since a was chosen arbitrarily from A, this reasoning applies to all elements of A. Thus, every element of A is also an element of C, which means A ⊆C by definition of a subset.

For each i ∈[4], the condition xi ≥11 can be reduced by setting x′ i = xi −11. Substituting into the equation, this corresponds to finding nonnegative integer solutions to x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 23. Thus, |Ai|= \u001223 + 4 −1 4 −1 \u0013 = \u001226 3 \u0013 . For i ̸= j ∈[4], the condition xi ≥11 and xj ≥11 similarly reduces the equation to x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 12, so |Ai ∩Aj|= \u001212 + 4 −1 4 −1 \u0013 = \u001215 3 \u0013 . For i ̸= j ̸= k ∈[4], the condition xi ≥11, xj ≥11, and xk ≥11 reduces the equation to x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 1, giving |Ai ∩Aj ∩Ak|= \u00121 + 4 −1 4 −1 \u0013 = \u00124 3 \u0013 . Finally, if xi ≥11 for all i ∈[4], then x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 ≥44, 240\n\n which is impossible since the original equation sums to 34. Hence, |A1 ∩A2 ∩A3 ∩A4|= 0. Using the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion, we compute: |A1 ∩A2 ∩A3 ∩A4| = \u001237 3 \u0013 − \u00124 1 \u0013\u001226 3 \u0013 + \u00124 2 \u0013\u001215 3 \u0013 − \u00124 3 \u0013\u00124 3 \u0013 + 0 = 750 .

Constructing the Naturals In this course, we take the natural numbers for granted, but it is possible to construct them formally inside modern set theory. The most commonly used foundation is Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC). A.1. The ZFC Axioms (Informal List) ZFC is a collection of axioms that govern the behavior of sets. • Extensionality: Two sets are equal if and only if they have the same elements. • Empty Set: There exists a set, denoted ∅, with no elements. • Pairing: For any sets a and b, there exists a set {a, b}. • Union: For any set A, there exists a set S A whose elements are exactly those belonging to members of A. • Power Set: For any set A, there exists a set P(A) whose elements are all subsets of A. • Specification (Subset Axiom Scheme): Given any set A and any property P(x) (expressible in the language of set theory), there exists a set {x ∈A | P(x)}. • Replacement (Axiom Scheme): The image of any set under any definable function is itself a set. • Infinity: There exists an inductive set I such that ∅∈I and for all x ∈I, the successor x ∪{x} is also in I. • Foundation (Regularity): Every non-empty set A contains an element a that is disjoint from A (i.e., a ∩A = ∅). • Choice: For any collection of nonempty sets, there is a function that chooses one element from each set. The Axiom of Infinity is crucial here: it guarantees the existence of at least one inductive set from which we can build the natural numbers. (The Axiom of Choice is not needed for N itself, but is included in ZFC for broader mathematics.) 243\n\n A.2. The Successor Function Define the successor of a set x as S(x) := x ∪{x}. This ensures x ∈S(x) and x ⊊S(x), mimicking the intuitive “add one” operation. A.3. Defining N The Axiom of Infinity provides an inductive set I. However, I may contain extra elements. To obtain the smallest inductive set, we apply the Axiom of Specification to define: N := \\ {X ⊆I : ∅∈X and ∀x ∈X, S(x) ∈X}. This set N is the intersection of all inductive subsets of I. It is itself inductive and is the unique minimal inductive set. A.4. The von Neumann Ordinals With this construction, each natural number is identified with a specific set: 0 := ∅, 1 := S(0) = {∅} = {0}, 2 := S(1) = {∅, {∅}} = {0, 1}, 3 := S(2) = {0, 1, 2}, ... n := {0, 1, 2, . . . , n −1}. In other words, each n is the set of all smaller natural numbers. This construction also defines the usual ordering: m < n if and only if m ∈n. A.5. Arithmetic on N Addition and multiplication can be defined recursively using the successor function. For example, addition is defined by: m + 0 := m, m + S(n) := S(m + n). 244\n\n From these definitions, all familiar properties of arithmetic (commutativity, associativity, distributivity, etc.) can be derived using induction. This development is rigorous but lengthy, and is typically studied in more advanced logic or set theory courses. A.6. Induction as a Theorem Since N is defined as the smallest inductive set, the Principle of Mathematical Induction follows as a theorem in ZFC. Theorem A.6.1 (Principle of Mathematical Induction). Let X ⊆N. If: 1. 0 ∈X, and 2. ∀n ∈N, (n ∈X =⇒S(n) ∈X), then X = N. Proof Sketch. The assumptions say that X is inductive. Since N is defined as the intersection of all inductive sets contained in some inductive I, it follows that N ⊆X. The reverse inclusion X ⊆N is immediate from the definition of X as a subset of N. Hence X = N. This theorem directly implies the familiar induction principle for statements: if a property P(n) holds for n = 0 and P(n) implies P(n + 1) for all n, then P(n) holds for all n ∈N (by considering the set X = {n ∈N | P(n) is true}). 245\n\n Solutions/Hints for Exercises 246\n\n Solutions and Hints 1. August 25 Exercise 1.2.1 Which of the following are mathematical statements? Justify your answer. (a) Pittsburgh has the most bridges of any city in the world. Solution. This is a mathematical statement. (b) Pittsburgh is the best city in the world. Solution. Maybe. We would need a formal definition of “best” in order for this to be a statement. (c) Where is Pittsburgh? Solution. This is not a statement. (d) 2 is a prime number. Solution. This is a statement. (e) n is a prime number. Solution. This is not a statement. (n is a free variable.)

(x is still a free variable.) Exercise 1.2.2 Consider the following theorem and proof: Theorem: If m and m + n are both even integers then n is an even integer. Proof : Let m = 2a and n = 2b, where a and b are integers. Then m + n = 2a + 2b. Subtracting m from both sides we get n = 2a + 2b −m = 2a + 2b −2a = 2b Therefore we have shown n is even. (a) Is this theorem true? Solution. Yes. This is a true statement. (b) Is the proof valid and well written? Explain your reasoning. Solution. The proof is invalid, but not poorly written. In the theorem, the assumptions were that m and m + n were both even, but in the proof the author assumed m and n were even. In particular, the author used cyclic reasoning by assuming n was even in order to prove that n was even. (c) If your answer to (a) is yes and (b) is no, try to fix the proof. What are the basic assumptions of this proposition? If your answer to (a) is no, try to fix the proposition to make it true and then prove it.\n\n**Proof:** Let P and Q be arbitrary and fixed propositions. The following truth table verifies that ¬(P ∧Q) ≡(¬P ∨¬Q). P Q P ∧Q ¬(P ∧Q) ¬P ¬Q ¬P ∨¬Q ¬(P ∧Q) ↔(¬P ∨¬Q) T T T F F F F T T F F T F T T T F T F T T F T T F F F T T T T T Note. As we’ve seen a little bit already, we can nest compound propositions as deeply as we like. We use parentheses to disambiguate propositions. We list a few more important logical equivalences. These will be useful for understanding the logical negation of a proposition as well as developing proof techniques for our 26\n\n propositions. All of these theorems are proven via simple truth tables. We’ll state most of them without proof. Theorem 4.1.2 (Distributive Law for Connectives). For all propositions P, Q, and R, the following logical equivalences hold: 1. P ∧(Q ∨R) ≡(P ∧Q) ∨(P ∧R) 2. P ∨(Q ∧R) ≡(P ∨Q) ∧(P ∨R) Theorem 4.1.3 (Law of Double Negation). For any proposition P, ¬¬P ≡P. Theorem 4.1.4 (Commutative Law). For any propositions P and Q, the following are true: 1. P ∧Q ≡Q ∧P 2. P ∨Q ≡Q ∨P Theorem 4.1.5 (Associative Law). For any propositions P, Q, and R, the following are true: 1. (P ∧Q) ∧R ≡P ∧(Q ∧R) 2. (P ∨Q) ∨R ≡P ∨(Q ∨R) The associative law allows us to drop some parentheses in our statement without losing unique readability. If the connectives are all ∧’s or ∨’s, then the parentheses are not necessary. Since (P ∧Q)∧R ≡P ∧(Q∧R), we do not need to disambiguate between these two propositions. We may simply write P ∧Q ∧R. Similarly, we may write P ∨Q ∨R in place of (P ∨Q) ∨R or P ∨(Q ∨R). Note. When the connectives are a mix of ∧’s and ∨’s, we still need parentheses. As we can see from Theorem 4.1.2, P ∧(Q ∨R) ̸≡(P ∧Q) ∨R. Simply writing ”P ∧Q ∨R” is ambiguous and not considered a well-formed proposition. Theorem 4.1.6 (Biconditional Equivalence). For any propositions P and Q, P ↔Q ≡(P →Q) ∧(Q →P). Theorem 4.1.7 (Disjunctive Form of Implication). For any propositions P and Q, P →Q ≡¬P ∨Q. 27\n\n Recall that ¬Q →¬P is called the contrapositive of P →Q. It is an important fact in mathematics that these two sentence structures are always logically equivalent. Later, when we discuss proof writing, this logical equivalence will give us an important proof technique known as a proof by contraposition. Theorem 4.1.8 (Contraposition). For any propositions P and Q, P →Q ≡¬Q →¬P. Proof. Let P and Q be arbitrary and fixed propositions. The following truth table demonstrates the logical equivalence between P →Q and ¬Q →¬P.

Write the contrapositive of the following statements in natural, idiomatic English. (a) If I do my assignments, I will get a good grade in the course. (b) I will not be late unless there is traffic. 4.1.2. Predicate Logic Propositional logic has some severe limitations. For instance, how could we express propositions such as “The square of every real number is nonnegative” or “There exists a negative real number” in propositional logic? To handle statements of this form, we introduce predicate logic. Recall: A predicate or variable proposition is a statement involving free (unbound) variables. A predicate itself does not have a truth value, but it takes on a truth value once its variables are specified. 28", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}
{"instruction": "Prove that Let m ∈N, S be a finite set, and A1, A2, . . . , Am ∈P(S). Further, assume that for each X ⊆[m], the cardinality | T i∈X Ai| depends only on |X|.

How many integers between 0 and 99,999 have, among their digits, at least one occurrence of 2, 5, and 8? Let S be the set of integers between 0 and 99,999. Then |S|= 105. Define: A2 = {x ∈S | none of the digits of x are 2}, A5 = {x ∈S | none of the digits of x are 5}, A8 = {x ∈S | none of the digits of x are 8}. We wish to find |A2 ∩A5 ∩A8|, the number of integers that include at least one of the digits 2, 5, and 8. Using De Morgan’s laws: |A2 ∩A5 ∩A8| = |S|−|A2 ∪A5 ∪A8|. To compute |A2 ∪A5 ∪A8|, we use PIE. Note: • |Ai|= 95 for each i ∈{2, 5, 8}, as these are integers with 5 digits, excluding one specific digit (9 choices per digit). • |Ai ∩Aj|= 85 for all i ̸= j ∈{2, 5, 8}, since these are integers excluding two specific digits (8 choices per digit). • |A2 ∩A5 ∩A8|= 75, as these are integers excluding all three digits (7 choices per digit). Applying PIE: |A2 ∪A5 ∪A8|= \u00123 1 \u0013 95 − \u00123 2 \u0013 85 + \u00123 3 \u0013 75. Therefore, |A2 ∩A5 ∩A8| = |S|−|A2 ∪A5 ∪A8|= 105 −3 · 95 + 3 · 85 −75 239\n\n We conclude our discussion of the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion with one final example. Example 37.2.5. Find the number of nonnegative integer solutions to the equation x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 34 such that 0 ≤xi ≤10 for each i ∈{1, 2, 3, 4}. First, let S be the set of nonnegative integer solutions to the equation without the restriction 0 ≤xi ≤10. Using the stars-and-bars formula, the total number of solutions is |S|= \u001234 + 4 −1 4 −1 \u0013 = \u001237 3 \u0013 . For each i ∈[4], let Ai be the set of nonnegative integer solutions where xi ≥11. We wish to compute |A1 ∩A2 ∩A3 ∩A4|, the number of solutions satisfying 0 ≤xi ≤10 for all i. For each i ∈[4], the condition xi ≥11 can be reduced by setting x′ i = xi −11. Substituting into the equation, this corresponds to finding nonnegative integer solutions to x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 23. Thus, |Ai|= \u001223 + 4 −1 4 −1 \u0013 = \u001226 3 \u0013 . For i ̸= j ∈[4], the condition xi ≥11 and xj ≥11 similarly reduces the equation to x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 12, so |Ai ∩Aj|= \u001212 + 4 −1 4 −1 \u0013 = \u001215 3 \u0013 . For i ̸= j ̸= k ∈[4], the condition xi ≥11, xj ≥11, and xk ≥11 reduces the equation to x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 1, giving |Ai ∩Aj ∩Ak|= \u00121 + 4 −1 4 −1 \u0013 = \u00124 3 \u0013 . Finally, if xi ≥11 for all i ∈[4], then x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 ≥44, 240\n\n which is impossible since the original equation sums to 34. Hence, |A1 ∩A2 ∩A3 ∩A4|= 0. Using the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion, we compute: |A1 ∩A2 ∩A3 ∩A4| = \u001237 3 \u0013 − \u00124 1 \u0013\u001226 3 \u0013 + \u00124 2 \u0013\u001215 3 \u0013 − \u00124 3 \u0013\u00124 3 \u0013 + 0 = 750 .

Constructing the Naturals In this course, we take the natural numbers for granted, but it is possible to construct them formally inside modern set theory. The most commonly used foundation is Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC). A.1. The ZFC Axioms (Informal List) ZFC is a collection of axioms that govern the behavior of sets. • Extensionality: Two sets are equal if and only if they have the same elements. • Empty Set: There exists a set, denoted ∅, with no elements. • Pairing: For any sets a and b, there exists a set {a, b}. • Union: For any set A, there exists a set S A whose elements are exactly those belonging to members of A. • Power Set: For any set A, there exists a set P(A) whose elements are all subsets of A. • Specification (Subset Axiom Scheme): Given any set A and any property P(x) (expressible in the language of set theory), there exists a set {x ∈A | P(x)}. • Replacement (Axiom Scheme): The image of any set under any definable function is itself a set. • Infinity: There exists an inductive set I such that ∅∈I and for all x ∈I, the successor x ∪{x} is also in I. • Foundation (Regularity): Every non-empty set A contains an element a that is disjoint from A (i.e., a ∩A = ∅). • Choice: For any collection of nonempty sets, there is a function that chooses one element from each set. The Axiom of Infinity is crucial here: it guarantees the existence of at least one inductive set from which we can build the natural numbers. (The Axiom of Choice is not needed for N itself, but is included in ZFC for broader mathematics.) 243\n\n A.2. The Successor Function Define the successor of a set x as S(x) := x ∪{x}. This ensures x ∈S(x) and x ⊊S(x), mimicking the intuitive “add one” operation. A.3. Defining N The Axiom of Infinity provides an inductive set I. However, I may contain extra elements. To obtain the smallest inductive set, we apply the Axiom of Specification to define: N := \\ {X ⊆I : ∅∈X and ∀x ∈X, S(x) ∈X}. This set N is the intersection of all inductive subsets of I. It is itself inductive and is the unique minimal inductive set. A.4. The von Neumann Ordinals With this construction, each natural number is identified with a specific set: 0 := ∅, 1 := S(0) = {∅} = {0}, 2 := S(1) = {∅, {∅}} = {0, 1}, 3 := S(2) = {0, 1, 2}, ... n := {0, 1, 2, . . . , n −1}. In other words, each n is the set of all smaller natural numbers. This construction also defines the usual ordering: m < n if and only if m ∈n. A.5. Arithmetic on N Addition and multiplication can be defined recursively using the successor function. For example, addition is defined by: m + 0 := m, m + S(n) := S(m + n). 244\n\n From these definitions, all familiar properties of arithmetic (commutativity, associativity, distributivity, etc.) can be derived using induction. This development is rigorous but lengthy, and is typically studied in more advanced logic or set theory courses. A.6. Induction as a Theorem Since N is defined as the smallest inductive set, the Principle of Mathematical Induction follows as a theorem in ZFC. Theorem A.6.1 (Principle of Mathematical Induction).

Since N is defined as the intersection of all inductive sets contained in some inductive I, it follows that N ⊆X. The reverse inclusion X ⊆N is immediate from the definition of X as a subset of N. Hence X = N. This theorem directly implies the familiar induction principle for statements: if a property P(n) holds for n = 0 and P(n) implies P(n + 1) for all n, then P(n) holds for all n ∈N (by considering the set X = {n ∈N | P(n) is true}). 245\n\n Solutions/Hints for Exercises 246\n\n Solutions and Hints 1.

P Q P →Q ¬P ¬Q ¬Q →¬P (P →Q) ↔(¬Q →¬P) T T T F F T T T F F F T F T F T T T F T T F F T T T T T Exercise 4.1.9. Use truth tables to determine whether or not the given propositional formulae σ1 and σ2 are logically equivalent. σ1 = (P ∨Q) →R σ2 = (P →R) ∧(Q →R) Exercise 4.1.10. Write the contrapositive of the following statements in natural, idiomatic English. (a) If I do my assignments, I will get a good grade in the course. (b) I will not be late unless there is traffic. 4.1.2. Predicate Logic Propositional logic has some severe limitations. For instance, how could we express propositions such as “The square of every real number is nonnegative” or “There exists a negative real number” in propositional logic? To handle statements of this form, we introduce predicate logic. Recall: A predicate or variable proposition is a statement involving free (unbound) variables. A predicate itself does not have a truth value, but it takes on a truth value once its variables are specified. 28", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

Then it is not the case that every x ∈S satisfies P(x). Therefore, there must exist some x ∈S for which P(x) does not hold, i.e. ∃x ∈S, ¬P(x). • Conversely, assume ∃x ∈S, ¬P(x) holds. Then for some a ∈S, we have ¬P(a). This means not every element of S satisfies P(x), so ∀x ∈S, P(x) is false. Hence ¬ ∀x ∈S, P(x) is true. Now we have all the tools we need to maximally negate any proposition that we may encounter. Below, we present an example demonstrating a systematic method for finding the maximally negated form of a proposition. In general, you do not need to show these intermediate steps, but we include them here to illustrate the process. Example 5.1.3. Let P(x), Q(y), and R(x, y, z) be variable propositions. Consider the sentence σ given below ∀x ∈S, ∃y ∈S, ∀z ∈S, ((P(x) ∧Q(y)) →R(x, y, z)) We will write ¬σ in maximally negated form. ¬σ ≡¬∀x ∈S, ∃y ∈S, ∀z ∈S, ((P(x) ∧Q(y)) →R(x, y, z)) ≡∃x ∈S, ¬∃y ∈S, ∀z ∈S, ((P(x) ∧Q(y)) →R(x, y, z)) ≡∃x ∈S, ∀y ∈S, ¬∀z ∈S, ((P(x) ∧Q(y)) →R(x, y, z)) ≡∃x ∈S, ∀y ∈S, ∃z ∈S, ¬((P(x) ∧Q(y)) →R(x, y, z)) ≡∃x ∈S, ∀y ∈S, ∃z ∈S, ¬(¬(P(x) ∧Q(y)) ∨R(x, y, z)) ≡∃x ∈S, ∀y ∈S, ∃z ∈S, (¬¬(P(x) ∧Q(y)) ∧¬R(x, y, z)) ≡∃x ∈S, ∀y ∈S, ∃z ∈S, ((P(x) ∧Q(y)) ∧¬R(x, y, z)) Finally, using the associative law for conjunctions, we can simplify the expression by removing unnecessary parentheses without ambiguity. Thus, the maximally negated form of ¬σ is ¬σ ≡∃x ∈S, ∀y ∈S, ∃z ∈S, (P(x) ∧Q(y) ∧¬R(x, y, z)) 33\n\n Recipe for Finding a Maximally Negated Form 1. Move negations inward. Start with the outermost negation and apply the rules for negating quantifiers: ¬∀x ∈S, P(x) ≡∃x ∈S, ¬P(x), ¬∃x ∈S, P(x) ≡∀x ∈S, ¬P(x). 2. Push negations through connectives. Use DeMorgan’s Laws and doublenegation elimination: ¬(A ∧B) ≡(¬A ∨¬B), ¬(A ∨B) ≡(¬A ∧¬B), ¬¬A ≡A. 3. Rewrite implications. Replace A →B with ¬A ∨B before pushing negations inside. 4. Repeat until only atomic formulas are negated. Continue applying the rules until no quantifiers or connectives have a negation directly in front of them. At the end of this process, you will have a maximally negated form of the original proposition. Exercise 5.1.4. Write the logical negation of the following statements in maximally negated form. Next, determine whether the original statement or its negation is true, and briefly explain your reasoning. No formal proof is required. (a) ∀x ∈R, \u0000−1 < x < 1 →∃y ∈R, \u0000−1 < y < 1 ∧y2 = x3\u0001\u0001 (b) ∀x, y ∈R, (x = y ↔∀ε ∈R, (ε > 0 →|x −y|< ε) ) 5.2. Proof Writing Now that we have studied the structure of propositions and their negations, we are ready to discuss strategies for proving or disproving mathematical statements. We will break this discussion into steps, beginning with quantifiers and then moving on to implications and biconditionals. For each type of claim, we will examine both direct proofs and indirect proofs. A direct proof attempts to establish the truth of the statement as written. An indirect proof instead establishes the truth of a logically equivalent statement (for example, a contrapositive or the negation of the negation). 34\n\n 5.2.1. Universal Statements A universal statement is a proposition of the form ∀x ∈S, P(x). Direct Proofs Direct Proof Strategy Let x ∈S be arbitrary but fixed. Demonstrate that P(x) is true. Since x ∈S was chosen arbitrarily, we may conclude that ∀x ∈S, P(x) is true. As a common and important case, recall that for two sets A and B, we say A ⊆B if and only if ∀a ∈A, (a ∈B). To prove A ⊆B, we let a ∈A be arbitrary and then show that a ∈B. Proofs of this form are often called containment proofs, because we are showing that the set B “contains” all elements of A. Example 5.2.1. Let A = {n ∈Z | ∃m ∈Z, n = 10m −15} and B = {n ∈Z | ∃m ∈Z, n = 5m}. Prove that A ⊆B. Proof. Let a ∈A be an arbitrary and fixed element. By definition of A, there exists m ∈Z such that a = 10m −15. Fix such an m. Factoring out a 5, we obtain a = 10m −15 = 5(2m −3). Since 2m −3 ∈Z, it follows that a = 5k for some integer k (namely k = 2m −3). Hence a ∈B. Because a was arbitrary, we conclude that A ⊆B. Note. In early proofs, it is important to explicitly emphasize that an element chosen from a set is both arbitrary and fixed. This reminds us that we are not working with a special example, but with a general placeholder element. Later, once this point has been internalized, we will typically write simply “Let a ∈A,” with the arbitrariness and fixedness of a understood from context. Indirect Proofs By Theorem 5.1.2, we know that ¬∀x ∈S, P(x) ≡ ∃x ∈S, ¬P(x). 35\n\n Indirect Proof Strategy To prove ∀x ∈S, P(x) indirectly, assume for the sake of contradiction (AFSOC) that ∃x ∈S, ¬P(x) holds. Fix such an x and proceed through a chain of logical deductions until you arrive at a contradiction. Conclude that ∀x ∈S, P(x) must be true. Example 5.2.2. Prove that ∀x, y ∈Z, x2 −4y2 ̸= 2. Proof. Assume for the sake of contradiction that there exist integers x, y ∈Z such that x2 −4y2 = 2. Fix such an x and y. Since x is an integer, it is either even or odd. We consider both cases. • Case 1: Suppose x is even. Then x = 2k for some k ∈Z. Fix such a k. Substituting into the equation gives (2k)2 −4y2 = 2 =⇒ 4k2 −4y2 = 2. Thus 4(k2 −y2) = 2, which implies 4 | 2, a contradiction. • Case 2: Suppose x is odd. Then, by the division algorithm, x = 2ℓ+ 1 for some ℓ∈Z. Fix such an ℓ. Substituting into the equation gives (2ℓ+ 1)2 −4y2 = 2 =⇒ 4ℓ2 + 4ℓ+ 1 −4y2 = 2. Rearranging, 4(ℓ2 + ℓ−y2) = 1. Since ℓ2 + ℓ−y2 ∈Z, this would imply 4 | 1, a contradiction. Since both cases lead to contradictions, our assumption was false. Therefore, ∀x, y ∈Z, x2 −4y2 ̸= 2. Exercise 5.2.3. Prove that there are no integer solutions to the equation m2 = 3n + 2. Exercise 5.2.4. Let A = {x ∈R | x2 −6x + 5 > 0} and B = (−∞, 1). Prove that B ⊆A. 5.2.2. Existential Statements An existential statement is a proposition of the form ∃x ∈S, P(x). 36\n\n Direct Proofs Direct Proof Strategy Demonstrate that there exists x ∈S such that P(x) holds. The most common approach is a proof by demonstration, where we provide a concrete example of an element x ∈S that satisfies P(x). Example 5.2.5. Prove ∃x ∈Q, (2x3 −x2 −4x + 2 = 0). Proof. Let f(x) = 2x3 −x2 −4x + 2. Note that we can factor f(x) as follows: 2x3 −x2 −4x + 2 = (2x −1)(x2 −2) Now, consider x = 1 2 ∈Q. Then f \u0000 1 2 \u0001 = (1 −1) \u0000 1 4 −2 \u0001 = 0 Therefore, there exists x ∈Q such that f(x) = 0, as desired. A proof by demonstration is also commonly used to disprove a universal statement by providing a counterexample. Specifically, to prove ¬∀x ∈S, P(x), it suffices to demonstrate that ∃x ∈S, ¬P(x). Example 5.2.6. Recall in Example 5.2.1 we proved that A ⊆B where A = {n ∈Z | ∃m ∈Z, n = 10m −15} and B = {n ∈Z | ∃m ∈Z, n = 5m} Now, prove that B ̸⊆A. To disprove the universal statement ∀b ∈B, (b ∈A), we need to find a counterexample showing ∃b ∈B, (b /∈A). Counterexample. Consider b = 0. We see that 0 ∈B because 0 = 5 · 0 and 0 ∈Z. However, 0 /∈A because 0 = 10m −15 if and only if m = 3 2, which is not an integer. Therefore, B ̸⊆A. 37\n\n 6. September 8 6.1. Proof Writing 6.1.1. Existential Statements Direct Proofs In addition to constructive proofs, we may also encounter non-constructive direct proofs. These establish the existence of certain elements without explicitly identifying them. The following is a classic example. Example 6.1.1. Claim: There exist two irrational numbers a and b such that ab ∈Q. We will demonstrate that such a and b exist without explicitly identifying them. For the purposes of this proof, assume that √ 2 is irrational (a fact we will soon prove). Proof. Consider √ 2 √ 2. This number is either rational or irrational. We consider both cases. • Case 1: √ 2 √ 2 ∈Q. Then a = √ 2 and b = √ 2 satisfy the claim. • Case 2: √ 2 √ 2 /∈Q. Then a = √ 2 √ 2 and b = √ 2 satisfy the claim because ab = \u0012√ 2 √ 2\u0013√ 2 = √ 2 2 = 2 ∈Q. Since one of these two cases must hold, we conclude that there exist irrational numbers a and b such that ab ∈Q. Many other common examples of non-constructive direct proofs exist. For instance, numerous proofs invoking the Mean Value Theorem or the Intermediate Value Theorem are non-constructive, since these theorems assert the existence of certain points but do not provide a way to find them explicitly. 38\n\n Indirect Proofs By Theorem 5.1.2, we know that ¬∃x ∈S, P(x) ≡∀x ∈S, ¬P(x). Indirect Proof Strategy Assume for the sake of contradiction that ∀x ∈S, ¬P(x) holds. Derive a contradiction from this assumption. Conclude that ∃x ∈S, P(x) must be true. A famous example of an indirect proof of an existential statement is the Pigeonhole Principle. Before stating and proving this theorem, we first need to define the floor and ceiling functions. Definition. Let x ∈R. • The floor of x, denoted ⌊x⌋, is the greatest integer n such that n ≤x. Equivalently, ⌊x⌋is the unique integer n ∈Z such that n ≤x < n + 1. • The ceiling of x, denoted ⌈x⌉, is the least integer n such that x ≤n. Equivalently, ⌈x⌉is the unique integer n ∈Z such that n −1 < x ≤n. Theorem 6.1.2 (Pigeonhole Principle). Let n, k ∈Z+. If n objects are placed into k boxes, then there exists a box containing at least ln k m objects. We will state this theorem more formally after our discussion of cardinality. Colloquially, the Pigeonhole Principle is often stated as: “If many pigeons fly into not very many pigeonholes, then at least one pigeonhole must contain multiple pigeons.” Proof. Suppose objects a1, a2, . . . , an are placed into boxes A1, A2, . . . , Ak. Assume for the sake of contradiction that ∀i ∈[k], Ai contains fewer than ln k m objects. Since each Ai contains an integer number of objects, this means ∀i ∈[k], Ai contains at most ln k m −1 objects. By definition of the ceiling function we have ln k m −1 < n k ≤ ln k m 39\n\n Therefore, the total number of objects in all k boxes is at most k · \u0010ln k m −1 \u0011 < k · n k = n, contradicting the fact that exactly n objects were placed into the boxes. Hence, there must exist some i ∈[k] such that Ai contains at least ln k m objects. Exercise 6.1.3. Returning to exercise 5.2.4, let A = {x ∈R | x2 −6x + 5 > 0} and B = (−∞, 1). Prove that A ̸⊆B. Exercise 6.1.4. Prove the following propositions: (a) ∃x ∈R, |x3|< x2 (b) For n ∈Z+ and x1, . . . , xn+1 ∈[0, 1], it is the case that: ∃i < j ∈[n+1], |xi −xj|≤1 n. 6.1.2. Conditional Statements Conditional statements are those of the form P →Q. Proofs of conditional statements are the most common type of proofs in mathematics. We now build on what we established with universal and existential statements to include this connective. Direct Proofs Direct Proof Strategy Assume P is true. Show that Q must also be true. We previously saw an example of this proof method when we proved Theorem 2.1.6 about the transitivity of divisibility. Symbolically, we can express this theorem as: ∀a, b, c ∈Z ((a | b ∧b | c) →a | c) To prove this, we let a, b, and c be arbitrary integers such that a | b and b | c. We then demonstrated, using the definition of divisibility, that a | c. Let’s look at another example of this proof technique. Example 6.1.5. Claim: For all integers n, if n is even then n2 is even. Symbolically, we can express this statement as ∀n ∈Z, \u0010 (∃m ∈Z, n = 2m) →(∃ℓ∈Z, n2 = 2ℓ) \u0011 . 40\n\n Proof. Let n ∈Z be arbitrary and fixed. Suppose that n is even. Then there exists m ∈Z such that n = 2m. Fix such an m. Squaring both sides of the equation gives n2 = (2m)2 = 4m2 = 2(2m2). Let ℓ= 2m2 ∈Z. Then n2 = 2ℓ, which shows that n2 is even, as desired. Indirect Proofs There are two types of indirect proofs for conditional statements that are often very similar: proof by contraposition and proof by contradiction. 1 (Proof by Contraposition) Recall the contrapositive logical equivalence from Theorem 4.1.8: P →Q ≡¬Q →¬P. Contrapositive Proof Strategy Assume ¬Q is true. Show that ¬P must also be true. 2 (Proof by Contradiction) From Theorem 4.1.7 (the disjunctive form of implication) and Theorem 4.1.1 (De Morgan’s laws) we have ¬(P →Q) ≡P ∧¬Q. Contradiction Proof Strategy Assume for the sake of contradiction that P ∧¬Q holds. Find a contradiction based on this assumption. Conclude that P →Q must hold. To see an example of the former, let’s look at the converse of Example 6.1.5. Example 6.1.6. Claim: For all integers n, if n2 is even then n is even. Symbolically, we can express this proposition as ∀n ∈Z, ((∃k ∈Z, n2 = 2k) →(∃ℓ∈Z, n = 2ℓ)). By Contraposition. Let n ∈Z (be arbitrary and fixed). It suffices to show that if n is not even, then n2 is also not even. Assume that n is not even, i.e., n is odd. Then there exists ℓ∈Z such that n = 2ℓ+ 1. Fix such an ℓ. Then n2 = (2ℓ+ 1)2 = 4ℓ2 + 4ℓ+ 1 = 2(2ℓ2 + 2ℓ) + 1. Since 2ℓ2 + 2ℓ∈Z, we have n2 = 2k + 1 for some k ∈Z. Hence n2 is odd, and therefore n2 is not even, as desired. 41\n\n We now look at a proof by contradiction. Example 6.1.7. Using the definition of the rational numbers and the properties of the integers, prove that for any real numbers x and y, if x is rational and y is irrational then x + y is irrational. Symbolically, we can express this proposition as ∀x, y ∈R, ((x ∈Q ∧y /∈Q) →x + y /∈Q). By Contradiction. Let x, y ∈R such that x ∈Q and y /∈Q. Assume for the sake of contradiction that x + y ∈Q. Since x, x + y ∈Q, there exist m, n, p, q ∈Z with n, q ̸= 0 such that x = m n and x + y = p q . Fix m, n, p, q. Then y = (x + y) −x = p q −m n = np −mq nq . Since np −mq, nq ∈Z with nq ̸= 0 (because n ̸= 0 and q ̸= 0), this implies that y ∈Q, contradicting our assumption that y /∈Q. Therefore x+y /∈Q, and the claim holds. Exercise 6.1.8. Consider the following proposition: ∀n ∈Z, \u0000∃m ∈Z, \u00002n2 + 3 = 5m \u0001 →∀k ∈Z, (n ̸= 5k) \u0001 (a) Write the logical negation of this proposition in maximally negated form. (b) Prove or disprove the original proposition. Clearly state any assumptions, provide justifications for your steps, and write a formal proof using only the properties of integers in an organized manner. Exercise 6.1.9. Prove or disprove the following proposition. Clearly state any assumptions, provide detailed justifications for your steps, and write a formal proof using only the definitions of even and odd integers and the assumed properties of integer arithmetic. Proposition: If n is an integer then n2 + n −41 is an odd number. Exercise 6.1.10. Prove the following proposition: ∀x, y ∈R, (x + y ≥0 →x3 + y3 ≥x2y + xy2) 42\n\n 7. September 10 7.1. Proof Writing 7.1.1. Biconditional Statements Biconditional statements are propositions of the form P ↔Q (read: “P if and only if Q,” or simply “P iff Q”). There are two common techniques for proving biconditional statements. 1 Standard Method: Prove both P →Q and Q →P separately, using any of the techniques from the previous section. These proofs together establish the biconditional. 2 Intermediary Method: Construct a chain of logical equivalences. Prove P ⇔A ⇔B ⇔· · · ⇔Q for some number of intermediate propositions A, B, . . .. Each step must be reversible when using this method. Standard Method Standard Method Prove both directions separately: • Assume P and show Q. • Assume Q and show P. Observe that if we combine our proofs from Examples 6.1.5 and 6.1.6, we have shown that for any integer n, n is even if and only if n2 is even. We state this as a proposition. Proposition 7.1.1. For all n ∈Z, n is even iff n2 is even. We now prove a more general version of this result. 43", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

By definition of A, there exists m ∈Z such that a = 10m −15. Fix such an m. Factoring out a 5, we obtain a = 10m −15 = 5(2m −3).

Substituting into the equation gives (2ℓ+ 1)2 −4y2 = 2 =⇒ 4ℓ2 + 4ℓ+ 1 −4y2 = 2. Rearranging, 4(ℓ2 + ℓ−y2) = 1. Since ℓ2 + ℓ−y2 ∈Z, this would imply 4 | 1, a contradiction.

Exercise 5.2.4. Let A = {x ∈R | x2 −6x + 5 > 0} and B = (−∞, 1). Prove that B ⊆A. 5.2.2. Existential Statements An existential statement is a proposition of the form ∃x ∈S, P(x). 36\n\n Direct Proofs Direct Proof Strategy Demonstrate that there exists x ∈S such that P(x) holds. The most common approach is a proof by demonstration, where we provide a concrete example of an element x ∈S that satisfies P(x). Example 5.2.5. Prove ∃x ∈Q, (2x3 −x2 −4x + 2 = 0). Proof. Let f(x) = 2x3 −x2 −4x + 2. Note that we can factor f(x) as follows: 2x3 −x2 −4x + 2 = (2x −1)(x2 −2) Now, consider x = 1 2 ∈Q. Then f \u0000 1 2 \u0001 = (1 −1) \u0000 1 4 −2 \u0001 = 0 Therefore, there exists x ∈Q such that f(x) = 0, as desired. A proof by demonstration is also commonly used to disprove a universal statement by providing a counterexample. Specifically, to prove ¬∀x ∈S, P(x), it suffices to demonstrate that ∃x ∈S, ¬P(x). Example 5.2.6. Recall in Example 5.2.1 we proved that A ⊆B where A = {n ∈Z | ∃m ∈Z, n = 10m −15} and B = {n ∈Z | ∃m ∈Z, n = 5m} Now, prove that B ̸⊆A. To disprove the universal statement ∀b ∈B, (b ∈A), we need to find a counterexample showing ∃b ∈B, (b /∈A). Counterexample. Consider b = 0. We see that 0 ∈B because 0 = 5 · 0 and 0 ∈Z. However, 0 /∈A because 0 = 10m −15 if and only if m = 3 2, which is not an integer. Therefore, B ̸⊆A. 37\n\n 6. September 8 6.1. Proof Writing 6.1.1. Existential Statements Direct Proofs In addition to constructive proofs, we may also encounter non-constructive direct proofs. These establish the existence of certain elements without explicitly identifying them. The following is a classic example. Example 6.1.1. Claim: There exist two irrational numbers a and b such that ab ∈Q. We will demonstrate that such a and b exist without explicitly identifying them. For the purposes of this proof, assume that √ 2 is irrational (a fact we will soon prove). Proof. Consider √ 2 √ 2. This number is either rational or irrational. We consider both cases. • Case 1: √ 2 √ 2 ∈Q. Then a = √ 2 and b = √ 2 satisfy the claim. • Case 2: √ 2 √ 2 /∈Q. Then a = √ 2 √ 2 and b = √ 2 satisfy the claim because ab = \u0012√ 2 √ 2\u0013√ 2 = √ 2 2 = 2 ∈Q. Since one of these two cases must hold, we conclude that there exist irrational numbers a and b such that ab ∈Q. Many other common examples of non-constructive direct proofs exist. For instance, numerous proofs invoking the Mean Value Theorem or the Intermediate Value Theorem are non-constructive, since these theorems assert the existence of certain points but do not provide a way to find them explicitly. 38\n\n Indirect Proofs By Theorem 5.1.2, we know that ¬∃x ∈S, P(x) ≡∀x ∈S, ¬P(x). Indirect Proof Strategy Assume for the sake of contradiction that ∀x ∈S, ¬P(x) holds. Derive a contradiction from this assumption. Conclude that ∃x ∈S, P(x) must be true. A famous example of an indirect proof of an existential statement is the Pigeonhole Principle. Before stating and proving this theorem, we first need to define the floor and ceiling functions. Definition. Let x ∈R. • The floor of x, denoted ⌊x⌋, is the greatest integer n such that n ≤x. Equivalently, ⌊x⌋is the unique integer n ∈Z such that n ≤x < n + 1. • The ceiling of x, denoted ⌈x⌉, is the least integer n such that x ≤n. Equivalently, ⌈x⌉is the unique integer n ∈Z such that n −1 < x ≤n. Theorem 6.1.2 (Pigeonhole Principle). Let n, k ∈Z+. If n objects are placed into k boxes, then there exists a box containing at least ln k m objects. We will state this theorem more formally after our discussion of cardinality. Colloquially, the Pigeonhole Principle is often stated as: “If many pigeons fly into not very many pigeonholes, then at least one pigeonhole must contain multiple pigeons.” Proof. Suppose objects a1, a2, . . . , an are placed into boxes A1, A2, . . . , Ak. Assume for the sake of contradiction that ∀i ∈[k], Ai contains fewer than ln k m objects. Since each Ai contains an integer number of objects, this means ∀i ∈[k], Ai contains at most ln k m −1 objects. By definition of the ceiling function we have ln k m −1 < n k ≤ ln k m 39\n\n Therefore, the total number of objects in all k boxes is at most k · \u0010ln k m −1 \u0011 < k · n k = n, contradicting the fact that exactly n objects were placed into the boxes. Hence, there must exist some i ∈[k] such that Ai contains at least ln k m objects. Exercise 6.1.3. Returning to exercise 5.2.4, let A = {x ∈R | x2 −6x + 5 > 0} and B = (−∞, 1). Prove that A ̸⊆B. Exercise 6.1.4. Prove the following propositions: (a) ∃x ∈R, |x3|< x2 (b) For n ∈Z+ and x1, . . . , xn+1 ∈[0, 1], it is the case that: ∃i < j ∈[n+1], |xi −xj|≤1 n. 6.1.2. Conditional Statements Conditional statements are those of the form P →Q. Proofs of conditional statements are the most common type of proofs in mathematics. We now build on what we established with universal and existential statements to include this connective. Direct Proofs Direct Proof Strategy Assume P is true. Show that Q must also be true. We previously saw an example of this proof method when we proved Theorem 2.1.6 about the transitivity of divisibility. Symbolically, we can express this theorem as: ∀a, b, c ∈Z ((a | b ∧b | c) →a | c) To prove this, we let a, b, and c be arbitrary integers such that a | b and b | c. We then demonstrated, using the definition of divisibility, that a | c. Let’s look at another example of this proof technique. Example 6.1.5. Claim: For all integers n, if n is even then n2 is even. Symbolically, we can express this statement as ∀n ∈Z, \u0010 (∃m ∈Z, n = 2m) →(∃ℓ∈Z, n2 = 2ℓ) \u0011 . 40\n\n Proof. Let n ∈Z be arbitrary and fixed. Suppose that n is even. Then there exists m ∈Z such that n = 2m. Fix such an m. Squaring both sides of the equation gives n2 = (2m)2 = 4m2 = 2(2m2). Let ℓ= 2m2 ∈Z. Then n2 = 2ℓ, which shows that n2 is even, as desired. Indirect Proofs There are two types of indirect proofs for conditional statements that are often very similar: proof by contraposition and proof by contradiction. 1 (Proof by Contraposition) Recall the contrapositive logical equivalence from Theorem 4.1.8: P →Q ≡¬Q →¬P. Contrapositive Proof Strategy Assume ¬Q is true. Show that ¬P must also be true. 2 (Proof by Contradiction) From Theorem 4.1.7 (the disjunctive form of implication) and Theorem 4.1.1 (De Morgan’s laws) we have ¬(P →Q) ≡P ∧¬Q. Contradiction Proof Strategy Assume for the sake of contradiction that P ∧¬Q holds. Find a contradiction based on this assumption. Conclude that P →Q must hold. To see an example of the former, let’s look at the converse of Example 6.1.5. Example 6.1.6. Claim: For all integers n, if n2 is even then n is even. Symbolically, we can express this proposition as ∀n ∈Z, ((∃k ∈Z, n2 = 2k) →(∃ℓ∈Z, n = 2ℓ)). By Contraposition. Let n ∈Z (be arbitrary and fixed). It suffices to show that if n is not even, then n2 is also not even. Assume that n is not even, i.e., n is odd. Then there exists ℓ∈Z such that n = 2ℓ+ 1. Fix such an ℓ. Then n2 = (2ℓ+ 1)2 = 4ℓ2 + 4ℓ+ 1 = 2(2ℓ2 + 2ℓ) + 1. Since 2ℓ2 + 2ℓ∈Z, we have n2 = 2k + 1 for some k ∈Z. Hence n2 is odd, and therefore n2 is not even, as desired. 41\n\n We now look at a proof by contradiction. Example 6.1.7. Using the definition of the rational numbers and the properties of the integers, prove that for any real numbers x and y, if x is rational and y is irrational then x + y is irrational. Symbolically, we can express this proposition as ∀x, y ∈R, ((x ∈Q ∧y /∈Q) →x + y /∈Q). By Contradiction. Let x, y ∈R such that x ∈Q and y /∈Q. Assume for the sake of contradiction that x + y ∈Q. Since x, x + y ∈Q, there exist m, n, p, q ∈Z with n, q ̸= 0 such that x = m n and x + y = p q . Fix m, n, p, q. Then y = (x + y) −x = p q −m n = np −mq nq . Since np −mq, nq ∈Z with nq ̸= 0 (because n ̸= 0 and q ̸= 0), this implies that y ∈Q, contradicting our assumption that y /∈Q. Therefore x+y /∈Q, and the claim holds. Exercise 6.1.8. Consider the following proposition: ∀n ∈Z, \u0000∃m ∈Z, \u00002n2 + 3 = 5m \u0001 →∀k ∈Z, (n ̸= 5k) \u0001 (a) Write the logical negation of this proposition in maximally negated form. (b) Prove or disprove the original proposition. Clearly state any assumptions, provide justifications for your steps, and write a formal proof using only the properties of integers in an organized manner. Exercise 6.1.9. Prove or disprove the following proposition. Clearly state any assumptions, provide detailed justifications for your steps, and write a formal proof using only the definitions of even and odd integers and the assumed properties of integer arithmetic. Proposition: If n is an integer then n2 + n −41 is an odd number. Exercise 6.1.10. Prove the following proposition: ∀x, y ∈R, (x + y ≥0 →x3 + y3 ≥x2y + xy2) 42\n\n 7. September 10 7.1. Proof Writing 7.1.1. Biconditional Statements Biconditional statements are propositions of the form P ↔Q (read: “P if and only if Q,” or simply “P iff Q”). There are two common techniques for proving biconditional statements. 1 Standard Method: Prove both P →Q and Q →P separately, using any of the techniques from the previous section. These proofs together establish the biconditional. 2 Intermediary Method: Construct a chain of logical equivalences. Prove P ⇔A ⇔B ⇔· · · ⇔Q for some number of intermediate propositions A, B, . . .. Each step must be reversible when using this method. Standard Method Standard Method Prove both directions separately: • Assume P and show Q. • Assume Q and show P. Observe that if we combine our proofs from Examples 6.1.5 and 6.1.6, we have shown that for any integer n, n is even if and only if n2 is even. We state this as a proposition. Proposition 7.1.1. For all n ∈Z, n is even iff n2 is even. We now prove a more general version of this result. 43", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

Thus, if mn is even, then at least one of m or n must be even. (⇐) Suppose either m is even or n is even. We consider two cases. ▶Case 1: m is even. Then m = 2k for some k ∈Z, so mn = (2k)n = 2(kn).

Prove R. • (Indirect Proof) Use contraposition: assume ¬Q and ¬R, and prove ¬P. Example 7.1.4. In the forward direction of Theorem 7.1.2, we previously used contraposition. Below we rewrite the proof using a direct method. Proof. (⇒): Let m, n ∈Z such that mn is even. Then mn = 2k for some k ∈Z. Fix k. We want to show that either m is even or n is even. If m is even, the proof is complete. Otherwise, m is odd, so m = 2ℓ+ 1 for some ℓ∈Z. Fix ℓ. Then 2k = mn = (2ℓ+ 1)n = 2ℓn + n. Rearranging yields n = 2k −2ℓn = 2(k −ℓn).

For the product to be negative, one of the factors must be positive and the other must be negative. Thus, either: ▶a −4 > 0 and a + 3 < 0, which implies a > 4 and a < −3, an impossibility; ▶or a −4 < 0 and a + 3 > 0, which implies −3 < a < 4. Therefore, a ∈(−3, 4) = B, showing that A ⊆B. (⊇) Let b ∈B. Then b ∈R and −3 < b < 4. Rearranging, we have b + 3 > 0 and b −4 < 0. Hence, (b −4)(b + 3) < 0. Hence, b2 −b −12 < 0, which means b ∈A. Therefore, B ⊆A. By double containment, we conclude that A = B. 8.1.2. Power Sets A fundamental concept in set theory is the power set. Given any set A, the power set of A, denoted by P(A), is the set of all subsets of A. This includes every possible subset, ranging from the empty set to the set A itself. In other words, the power set collects all the different ways elements of A can be grouped into subsets, providing a comprehensive view of the structure of A. Understanding power sets is important because they play a significant role in many areas of mathematics, including combinatorics, probability, and logic. Power sets are also central to discussions about cardinality, since the size of P(A) is always strictly larger than the size of A. We will return to this point when we discuss Cantor’s theorem and the idea of different sizes of infinity. Definition. Let A be a set. The power set of A, denoted P(A), is the set of all subsets of A. That is, P(A) = {B | B ⊆A}. Example 8.1.2. Let A = {a, b}. Then the distinct subsets of A are ∅, {a}, {b}, A. Therefore, P(A) = {∅, {a}, {b}, A}. (A set of sets!) 52\n\n The following theorem is immediate from the definition. Theorem 8.1.3. For any set A, ∅∈P(A) and A ∈P(A). Example 8.1.4. Consider the set ∅. Write ∅, P(∅), P(P(∅)), and P(P(P(∅))) in roster notation. • ∅= { } • P(∅) = {∅} Note that ∅̸= {∅}. If we view a set as a “bag,” then ∅is a bag with nothing in it, while {∅} is a bag containing an empty bag. • P(P(∅)) = {∅, P(∅)} = {∅, {∅}} • P(P(P(∅))) = {∅, {∅}, {{∅}}, {∅, {∅}}} Exercise 8.1.5.

Determine whether the following statements are True or False. 1. ∅∈P(A) 2. ∅⊆P(A) 3. {∅} ∈P(A) 4. {∅} ⊆P(A) 5. 1 ∈P(A) 6. {1} ∈P(A) 7. {1} ⊆P(A) 8. {{1}} ∈P(A) 9. {{1}} ⊆P(A) 10. {0, 2} ∈P(A) 11. {0, 2} ⊆P(A) 8.1.3. Fundamental Set Operations Let A and B be arbitrary sets, and let U be a set (called a universal set) such that A ⊆U and B ⊆U. Pairwise Intersection The intersection of sets A and B, denoted A ∩B, is the set of all elements that A and B have in common. A ∩B = {x ∈U | x ∈A ∧x ∈B} Below is the standard Venn diagram representing the intersection of two sets. 53\n\n If A ∩B = ∅, then A and B are said to be disjoint. Pairwise Union The union of A and B, denoted A ∪B, is the set of all elements that are members of either A or B (or both). A ∪B = {x ∈U | x ∈A ∨x ∈B} Below is the standard Venn diagram representing the union of two sets. The following are some basic properties of intersections and unions. Theorem 8.1.6. Let A and B be arbitrary sets. Then 1. A ∩B = B ∩A 2. A ∪B = B ∪A 3. A ∩B ⊆A 4. A ⊆A ∪B 5. A ⊆B iff A ∩B = A Properties (1) and (2) follow from the symmetry of “and” and “or” in logic (P ∧Q ≡ Q ∧P, P ∨Q ≡Q ∨P). We now prove the remaining properties. Proof. 54\n\n 3. Let x ∈A ∩B. By definition of intersection, x ∈A and x ∈B. Hence x ∈A. Since x was arbitrary, we conclude A ∩B ⊆A. 4. Let a ∈A. Then, by the definition of union, a ∈A ∪B. Therefore, A ⊆A ∪B. 5. (⇒) Suppose A ⊆B. We want to show that A ∩B = A. From property (3), we already know A ∩B ⊆A. It remains to show A ⊆A ∩B. Let a ∈A. Since A ⊆B, we also have a ∈B. Thus a ∈A ∩B by definition of intersection. Therefore A ⊆A ∩B, and hence A = A ∩B. (⇐) Suppose A = A ∩B. Let a ∈A. Then a ∈A ∩B, so a ∈B by definition of intersection. Therefore A ⊆B. Set Difference The set difference between sets A and B, denoted A∖B, is the set of all elements which are in A but not in B. A ∖B = {x ∈U | x ∈A ∧x /∈B} Below is the standard Venn diagram representing the set difference A ∖B. Complement The complement of a set A, denoted A or Ac, is the set of all elements in U that are not in A. A = {x ∈U | x /∈A} = U ∖A Note that the definition of A depends on the choice of U. Often, the universal set U is not explicitly stated but is understood from context. Below is the standard Venn diagram for this definition. 55\n\n Summary Operation Notation / Definition Description Intersection A ∩B = {x ∈U | x ∈A ∧x ∈B} Elements in both A and B Union A ∪B = {x ∈U | x ∈A ∨x ∈B} Elements in A, or in B, or in both Difference A ∖B = {x ∈U | x ∈A ∧x /∈B} Elements in A but not in B Complement A = U ∖A = {x ∈U | x /∈A} Elements in U not in A Exercise 8.1.7.

A ∖(B ∩C) Indexed Unions and Intersections Indexing sets is useful when we want to define or reference a large (possibly infinite) number of sets without listing each one explicitly. Definition. Let I be a set. A family of sets indexed by I, or simply an indexed family of sets, is a collection where each element of I corresponds to a set Ai. The set I is called an index set. We typically denote the indexed family of sets as either {Ai | i ∈I} or {Ai}i∈I. Example 8.1.8. For each i ∈N, define Ai = [2i + 1] ∖[i]. 56\n\n Then F = {Ai | i ∈N} is a family of sets indexed by N. Each set Ai has an explicit definition in terms of i (this is common). For instance: A0 = [1] ∖[0] = {1}, A1 = [3] ∖[1] = {2, 3}, A2 = [5] ∖[2] = {3, 4, 5}, A3 = [7] ∖[3] = {4, 5, 6, 7}. Definition. Let {Ai}i∈I be an indexed family of sets. We define: • Indexed Intersection: \\ i∈I Ai = {x ∈U | ∀i ∈I, x ∈Ai}. • Indexed Union: [ i∈I Ai = {x ∈U | ∃i ∈I, x ∈Ai}. Example 8.1.9. Consider the family of sets from Example 8.1.8. We determine its indexed intersection and union. Claim 1. T i∈N Ai = ∅. Proof. Assume for the sake of contradiction that there exists x ∈T i∈N Ai. Then, by definition of an indexed intersection, x ∈Ai for all i ∈N. Therefore, x ∈A0 and x ∈A1, and hence x ∈A0 ∩A1. However, A0 ∩A1 = {1} ∩{2, 3} = ∅, a contradiction. Hence T i∈N Ai = ∅. Claim 2: S i∈N Ai = Z+ Proof. (⊆) Let x ∈S i∈N Ai. By definition of an indexed union, x ∈Ai for some i ∈N. Fix such an i. From the definition of Ai, we have x ∈[2i + 1] ∖[i] and hence x ∈[2i + 1] by the definition of a set difference. Since x ∈[2i + 1], it follows that x ∈Z+. Therefore, S i∈N Ai ⊆Z+. 57\n\n (⊇) Let x ∈Z+ be arbitrary and fixed. Consider Ax−1 = [2x −1] ∖[x −1]. Since x ≥1, we have x −1 ≥0 and 2x −1 ≥x. Thus x ∈[2x −1]. Moreover, since x > x −1, we have x /∈[x −1]. Hence x ∈Ax−1 by definition of set difference. Therefore x ∈S i∈N Ai by definition of an indexed union. Since x was arbitrary, we conclude that Z+ ⊆S i∈N Ai. By double containment, S i∈N Ai = Z+. Exercise 8.1.10. Write the following sets in either interval notation or roster notation.

Sets Part 2 9.1.1. De Morgan’s Laws for Sets In propositional logic, De Morgan’s Laws describe how negation interacts with conjunctions and disjunctions. These laws have direct analogs in set theory, where they describe the relationship between set complements, unions, and intersections. Understanding these laws helps us manipulate and simplify expressions involving sets, just as in logic. Theorem 9.1.1 (DeMorgan’s Laws). If A, X, Y are sets, then 1. A ∖(X ∪Y ) = (A ∖X) ∩(A ∖Y ) 2. A ∖(X ∩Y ) = (A ∖X) ∪(A ∖Y ) Additionally, let {Xi | i ∈I} be an indexed family of sets. Then 3. A ∖S i∈I Xi = T i∈I (A ∖Xi) 4. A ∖T i∈I Xi = S i∈I (A ∖Xi) We will prove the fourth statement. The remaining cases follow in a similar way. Proof of (4). Let A be a set and {Xi | i ∈I} an indexed family of sets. We prove that A ∖ \\ i∈I Xi = [ i∈I (A ∖Xi) by double containment. (⊆) Suppose a ∈A ∖T i∈I Xi. Then a ∈A and a /∈T i∈I Xi, by definition of set difference. By the definition of an indexed intersection, there exists some j ∈I such that a /∈Xj. Fix such a j. Since a ∈A and a /∈Xj, we have that a ∈A ∖Xi. By the definition of an indexed union, it follows that a ∈S i∈I (A ∖Xi). Therefore, A ∖T i∈I Xi ⊆S i∈I (A ∖Xi). 59\n\n (⊇) Let a ∈S i∈I (A∖Xi). By the definition of an indexed union, there exists some j ∈I such that a ∈A ∖Xj. Fix such a j. By the definition of set difference, a ∈A and a /∈Xj. Since a /∈Xj, it follows that a /∈T i∈I Xi. Therefore, a ∈A ∖T i∈I Xi. Thus S i∈I(A ∖Xi) ⊆A ∖T i∈I Xi. By double containment, we conclude that A ∖ \\ i∈I Xi = [ i∈I (A ∖Xi). Corollary 9.1.2. Let A and B be subsets of a universal set U. Then 1. A ∩B = A ∪B 2. A ∪B = A ∩B 9.1.2. Cartesian Products In set theory, the Cartesian product of two sets provides a way to pair each element of one set with each element of another set. This operation is fundamental in many areas of mathematics, allowing us to construct ordered pairs and define relations and functions. The Cartesian product helps us explore the relationships between different sets in a structured manner. Definition. Let A and B be sets. The Cartesian product of A and B, denoted A × B is defined as follows: A × B = {(a, b) | a ∈A ∧b ∈B} where the elements (a, b) ∈A × B are ordered pairs. The defining property of an ordered pair is that for a, c ∈A and b, d ∈B (a, b) = (c, d) if and only if a = c and b = d. Note. To be precise, in formal set theory, an object having the same properties as an ordered pair can be defined using the Kuratowski definition: (a, b) = {{a}, {a, b}} Using this construction, the Cartesian product A × B is the set of all such ordered pairs where the first element is from A and the second element is from B. This formalism 60\n\n ensures that the order of the elements in the pair is maintained, which is crucial for distinguishing between (a, b) and (b, a) when a ̸= b. Example 9.1.3. N × Z = {(m, n) | m ∈N and n ∈Z} Z × N = {(m, n) | m ∈Z and n ∈N} Notice that Cartesian products are not commutative. N × Z ̸= Z × N. For instance, (0, −1) ∈N×Z but (0, −1) /∈Z×N because −1 /∈N. In fact, the only time A×B = B×A is when A and B are the same set, or when one of them is empty. Example 9.1.4. In the case where A and B are the same set, it is common to use exponential notation to represent the Cartesian product of the set with itself. This is seen most often in algebra and calculus when we talk about the Cartesian plane: R2 = R × R = {(x, y) | x, y ∈R} The Cartesian plane is simply the set of all possible ordered pairs of real numbers. Example 9.1.5. For any set A, we have A × ∅= ∅× A = ∅. Repeated Cartesian Products If we wanted to take a Cartesian product of three sets, there are a couple of ways we may do this: (A × B) × C = {((a, b), c) | a ∈A, b ∈B, c ∈C} A × (B × C) = {(a, (b, c)) | a ∈A, b ∈B, c ∈C} Although these sets are technically different, they are essentially the same in practice. There is a natural way to associate elements of (A×B)×C with elements of A×(B×C). Specifically, we can identify ((a, b), c) in (A × B) × C with (a, (b, c)) in A × (B × C). Therefore, the distinction in parentheses does not add meaningful information. To simplify notation, we typically drop the parentheses when dealing with repeated Cartesian products. We define an ordered triple (a, b, c) in the same way as an ordered pair, and extend the Cartesian product to three sets as follows: A × B × C = {(a, b, c) | a ∈A, b ∈B, c ∈C} If you have taken Calculus 3, you have likely worked extensively with ordered triples already. Just as the Cartesian plane is represented by R2, the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system is given by R3 = R × R × R = {(x, y, z) | x, y, z ∈R} 61\n\n More generally, if n ∈Z+ and A1, A2, . . . , An are sets, then A1 × A2 × · · · × An = n Y i=1 Ai = {(a1, a2, . . . , an) | a1 ∈A1 ∧a2 ∈A2 ∧· · · ∧an ∈An} where (a1, a2, . . . , an) is called an n-tuple. Example 9.1.6. Let R+ = (0, ∞), the set of positive real numbers. For each r ∈R+, define Ar = {(x, y) ∈R2 | 0 < y < −r 4x2 + r}. Also define B = {(x, y) ∈R2 | −2 < x < 2 and y > 0}. 1. Provide a graphical representation of A1, A4, and B. 2. Prove that S r∈R+ Ar = B. Proof. We proceed by double containment. (⊆) Let (x, y) ∈ S r∈R+ Ar be arbitrary and fixed. By definition of an indexed union we have (x, y) ∈Ar for some r ∈R+. Fix such an r. By definition of Ar we have 0 < y < −r 4x2 + r. Factoring gives −r 4x2 + r = −r 4(x2 −4) = −r 4(x −2)(x + 2). Since y > 0, the right-hand side must also be positive, which forces (x − 2)(x+2) < 0. This implies that (x−2) and (x+2) have opposite signs. Since x + 2 > x −2 it must be the case that x + 2 > 0 and x −2 < 0, which gives us that −2 < x < 2. Combining this with y > 0, we conclude (x, y) ∈B, as desired. 62\n\n (⊇) Let (x, y) ∈B be arbitrary and fixed. Then y > 0 and −2 < x < 2, so (x −2)(x + 2) < 0. We want r > 0 such that y < −r 4(x −2)(x + 2). Scratch Work: y < −r 4(x −2)(x + 2) ⇐⇒ − 4y (x −2)(x + 2) < r We know there must exist a positive real number greater than − 4y (x −2)(x + 2). We use this to continue the proof. Fix any r > − 4y (x −2)(x + 2). We observe that since y > 0, (x−2)(x+2) < 0, and − 4y (x −2)(x + 2) < r it must be the case that y < −r 4(x−2)(x+2). Thus we have (x, y) ∈R2 and 0 < y < −r 4(x −2)(x + 2), and therefore (x, y) ∈Ar. By definition of an indexed union, (x, y) ∈ S r∈R+ Ar, as desired. Since we have shown both containments, it follows that [ r∈R+ Ar = B. Exercise 9.1.7. Consider the following sets and determine whether the statements in (a)-(n) are True or False. A = {z ∈Z | −3 ≤z ≤3}, B = {y ∈Z | −5 < y < 6}, C = {x ∈R | x2 ≥9}, D = {x ∈R | x < −3}, E = {n ∈N | (∃k ∈N)(n = 2k)}.

Prove that for all sets A and B, A × B = B × A if and only if A = ∅ or B = ∅or A = B. Exercise 9.1.9. For any sets A and B, the symmetric difference of A and B, denoted A△B, is defined as: A△B = (A ∪B) ∖(A ∩B). (a) Prove, via double containment, that for any sets A and B, A△B = (A∖B)∪(B ∖ A). (b) Prove that A△B = ∅if and only if A = B. Exercise 9.1.10. For each of the following, either prove the statement using a set containment proof or disprove it by constructing a counterexample. (a) Prove or disprove: For any sets A, B, and C, (A ∪B) ∖C ⊆(A ∖(B ∪C)) ∪(B ∖(A ∪C)). (b) Prove or disprove: For any sets A, B, and C, (A ∖(B ∪C)) ∪(B ∖(A ∪C)) ⊆(A ∪B) ∖C. 9.1.3. Set Equality via Logical Equivalences Set equality can always be viewed as a biconditional statement, which is why double containment proofs and biconditional proofs share a similar structure. Let U be a universal set containing two sets A and B. Then the statement A = B can be written symbolically as ∀x ∈U, (x ∈A ↔x ∈B). Recall that one way to prove a biconditional statement is by constructing a chain of logical equivalences. This method can also be applied to sets. It is particularly useful when the proof relies on definitions, algebraic manipulations, or previously established biconditional results. However, it is important to recognize that this approach may not be suitable for all proofs, especially those that require more nuanced or intricate reasoning beyond straightforward equivalences. Before we do an example, we first need a lemma that will serve as a useful intermediary result. 64", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

Factoring gives (a −4)(a + 3) < 0. For the product to be negative, one of the factors must be positive and the other must be negative. Thus, either: ▶a −4 > 0 and a + 3 < 0, which implies a > 4 and a < −3, an impossibility; ▶or a −4 < 0 and a + 3 > 0, which implies −3 < a < 4. Therefore, a ∈(−3, 4) = B, showing that A ⊆B. (⊇) Let b ∈B. Then b ∈R and −3 < b < 4. Rearranging, we have b + 3 > 0 and b −4 < 0. Hence, (b −4)(b + 3) < 0. Hence, b2 −b −12 < 0, which means b ∈A. Therefore, B ⊆A. By double containment, we conclude that A = B. 8.1.2. Power Sets A fundamental concept in set theory is the power set. Given any set A, the power set of A, denoted by P(A), is the set of all subsets of A. This includes every possible subset, ranging from the empty set to the set A itself. In other words, the power set collects all the different ways elements of A can be grouped into subsets, providing a comprehensive view of the structure of A. Understanding power sets is important because they play a significant role in many areas of mathematics, including combinatorics, probability, and logic. Power sets are also central to discussions about cardinality, since the size of P(A) is always strictly larger than the size of A. We will return to this point when we discuss Cantor’s theorem and the idea of different sizes of infinity. Definition. Let A be a set. The power set of A, denoted P(A), is the set of all subsets of A. That is, P(A) = {B | B ⊆A}. Example 8.1.2. Let A = {a, b}. Then the distinct subsets of A are ∅, {a}, {b}, A. Therefore, P(A) = {∅, {a}, {b}, A}. (A set of sets!) 52\n\n The following theorem is immediate from the definition. Theorem 8.1.3. For any set A, ∅∈P(A) and A ∈P(A). Example 8.1.4. Consider the set ∅. Write ∅, P(∅), P(P(∅)), and P(P(P(∅))) in roster notation. • ∅= { } • P(∅) = {∅} Note that ∅̸= {∅}. If we view a set as a “bag,” then ∅is a bag with nothing in it, while {∅} is a bag containing an empty bag. • P(P(∅)) = {∅, P(∅)} = {∅, {∅}} • P(P(P(∅))) = {∅, {∅}, {{∅}}, {∅, {∅}}} Exercise 8.1.5. Let A = {0, 1, 2, {1}}. Determine whether the following statements are True or False. 1. ∅∈P(A) 2. ∅⊆P(A) 3. {∅} ∈P(A) 4. {∅} ⊆P(A) 5. 1 ∈P(A) 6. {1} ∈P(A) 7. {1} ⊆P(A) 8. {{1}} ∈P(A) 9. {{1}} ⊆P(A) 10. {0, 2} ∈P(A) 11. {0, 2} ⊆P(A) 8.1.3. Fundamental Set Operations Let A and B be arbitrary sets, and let U be a set (called a universal set) such that A ⊆U and B ⊆U. Pairwise Intersection The intersection of sets A and B, denoted A ∩B, is the set of all elements that A and B have in common. A ∩B = {x ∈U | x ∈A ∧x ∈B} Below is the standard Venn diagram representing the intersection of two sets. 53\n\n If A ∩B = ∅, then A and B are said to be disjoint. Pairwise Union The union of A and B, denoted A ∪B, is the set of all elements that are members of either A or B (or both). A ∪B = {x ∈U | x ∈A ∨x ∈B} Below is the standard Venn diagram representing the union of two sets. The following are some basic properties of intersections and unions. Theorem 8.1.6. Let A and B be arbitrary sets. Then 1. A ∩B = B ∩A 2. A ∪B = B ∪A 3. A ∩B ⊆A 4. A ⊆A ∪B 5. A ⊆B iff A ∩B = A Properties (1) and (2) follow from the symmetry of “and” and “or” in logic (P ∧Q ≡ Q ∧P, P ∨Q ≡Q ∨P). We now prove the remaining properties. Proof. 54\n\n 3. Let x ∈A ∩B. By definition of intersection, x ∈A and x ∈B. Hence x ∈A. Since x was arbitrary, we conclude A ∩B ⊆A. 4. Let a ∈A. Then, by the definition of union, a ∈A ∪B. Therefore, A ⊆A ∪B. 5. (⇒) Suppose A ⊆B. We want to show that A ∩B = A. From property (3), we already know A ∩B ⊆A. It remains to show A ⊆A ∩B. Let a ∈A. Since A ⊆B, we also have a ∈B. Thus a ∈A ∩B by definition of intersection. Therefore A ⊆A ∩B, and hence A = A ∩B. (⇐) Suppose A = A ∩B. Let a ∈A. Then a ∈A ∩B, so a ∈B by definition of intersection. Therefore A ⊆B. Set Difference The set difference between sets A and B, denoted A∖B, is the set of all elements which are in A but not in B. A ∖B = {x ∈U | x ∈A ∧x /∈B} Below is the standard Venn diagram representing the set difference A ∖B. Complement The complement of a set A, denoted A or Ac, is the set of all elements in U that are not in A. A = {x ∈U | x /∈A} = U ∖A Note that the definition of A depends on the choice of U. Often, the universal set U is not explicitly stated but is understood from context. Below is the standard Venn diagram for this definition. 55\n\n Summary Operation Notation / Definition Description Intersection A ∩B = {x ∈U | x ∈A ∧x ∈B} Elements in both A and B Union A ∪B = {x ∈U | x ∈A ∨x ∈B} Elements in A, or in B, or in both Difference A ∖B = {x ∈U | x ∈A ∧x /∈B} Elements in A but not in B Complement A = U ∖A = {x ∈U | x /∈A} Elements in U not in A Exercise 8.1.7.

A ∖(B ∩C) Indexed Unions and Intersections Indexing sets is useful when we want to define or reference a large (possibly infinite) number of sets without listing each one explicitly. Definition. Let I be a set. A family of sets indexed by I, or simply an indexed family of sets, is a collection where each element of I corresponds to a set Ai. The set I is called an index set. We typically denote the indexed family of sets as either {Ai | i ∈I} or {Ai}i∈I. Example 8.1.8. For each i ∈N, define Ai = [2i + 1] ∖[i]. 56\n\n Then F = {Ai | i ∈N} is a family of sets indexed by N. Each set Ai has an explicit definition in terms of i (this is common). For instance: A0 = [1] ∖[0] = {1}, A1 = [3] ∖[1] = {2, 3}, A2 = [5] ∖[2] = {3, 4, 5}, A3 = [7] ∖[3] = {4, 5, 6, 7}. Definition. Let {Ai}i∈I be an indexed family of sets. We define: • Indexed Intersection: \\ i∈I Ai = {x ∈U | ∀i ∈I, x ∈Ai}. • Indexed Union: [ i∈I Ai = {x ∈U | ∃i ∈I, x ∈Ai}. Example 8.1.9. Consider the family of sets from Example 8.1.8. We determine its indexed intersection and union. Claim 1. T i∈N Ai = ∅. Proof. Assume for the sake of contradiction that there exists x ∈T i∈N Ai. Then, by definition of an indexed intersection, x ∈Ai for all i ∈N. Therefore, x ∈A0 and x ∈A1, and hence x ∈A0 ∩A1. However, A0 ∩A1 = {1} ∩{2, 3} = ∅, a contradiction. Hence T i∈N Ai = ∅. Claim 2: S i∈N Ai = Z+ Proof. (⊆) Let x ∈S i∈N Ai. By definition of an indexed union, x ∈Ai for some i ∈N. Fix such an i. From the definition of Ai, we have x ∈[2i + 1] ∖[i] and hence x ∈[2i + 1] by the definition of a set difference. Since x ∈[2i + 1], it follows that x ∈Z+. Therefore, S i∈N Ai ⊆Z+. 57\n\n (⊇) Let x ∈Z+ be arbitrary and fixed. Consider Ax−1 = [2x −1] ∖[x −1]. Since x ≥1, we have x −1 ≥0 and 2x −1 ≥x. Thus x ∈[2x −1]. Moreover, since x > x −1, we have x /∈[x −1]. Hence x ∈Ax−1 by definition of set difference. Therefore x ∈S i∈N Ai by definition of an indexed union. Since x was arbitrary, we conclude that Z+ ⊆S i∈N Ai. By double containment, S i∈N Ai = Z+. Exercise 8.1.10. Write the following sets in either interval notation or roster notation.

N × Z = {(m, n) | m ∈N and n ∈Z} Z × N = {(m, n) | m ∈Z and n ∈N} Notice that Cartesian products are not commutative. N × Z ̸= Z × N. For instance, (0, −1) ∈N×Z but (0, −1) /∈Z×N because −1 /∈N. In fact, the only time A×B = B×A is when A and B are the same set, or when one of them is empty. Example 9.1.4. In the case where A and B are the same set, it is common to use exponential notation to represent the Cartesian product of the set with itself. This is seen most often in algebra and calculus when we talk about the Cartesian plane: R2 = R × R = {(x, y) | x, y ∈R} The Cartesian plane is simply the set of all possible ordered pairs of real numbers. Example 9.1.5. For any set A, we have A × ∅= ∅× A = ∅. Repeated Cartesian Products If we wanted to take a Cartesian product of three sets, there are a couple of ways we may do this: (A × B) × C = {((a, b), c) | a ∈A, b ∈B, c ∈C} A × (B × C) = {(a, (b, c)) | a ∈A, b ∈B, c ∈C} Although these sets are technically different, they are essentially the same in practice. There is a natural way to associate elements of (A×B)×C with elements of A×(B×C). Specifically, we can identify ((a, b), c) in (A × B) × C with (a, (b, c)) in A × (B × C). Therefore, the distinction in parentheses does not add meaningful information. To simplify notation, we typically drop the parentheses when dealing with repeated Cartesian products. We define an ordered triple (a, b, c) in the same way as an ordered pair, and extend the Cartesian product to three sets as follows: A × B × C = {(a, b, c) | a ∈A, b ∈B, c ∈C} If you have taken Calculus 3, you have likely worked extensively with ordered triples already. Just as the Cartesian plane is represented by R2, the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system is given by R3 = R × R × R = {(x, y, z) | x, y, z ∈R} 61\n\n More generally, if n ∈Z+ and A1, A2, . . . , An are sets, then A1 × A2 × · · · × An = n Y i=1 Ai = {(a1, a2, . . . , an) | a1 ∈A1 ∧a2 ∈A2 ∧· · · ∧an ∈An} where (a1, a2, . . . , an) is called an n-tuple. Example 9.1.6. Let R+ = (0, ∞), the set of positive real numbers. For each r ∈R+, define Ar = {(x, y) ∈R2 | 0 < y < −r 4x2 + r}. Also define B = {(x, y) ∈R2 | −2 < x < 2 and y > 0}. 1. Provide a graphical representation of A1, A4, and B. 2. Prove that S r∈R+ Ar = B. Proof. We proceed by double containment. (⊆) Let (x, y) ∈ S r∈R+ Ar be arbitrary and fixed. By definition of an indexed union we have (x, y) ∈Ar for some r ∈R+. Fix such an r. By definition of Ar we have 0 < y < −r 4x2 + r. Factoring gives −r 4x2 + r = −r 4(x2 −4) = −r 4(x −2)(x + 2). Since y > 0, the right-hand side must also be positive, which forces (x − 2)(x+2) < 0. This implies that (x−2) and (x+2) have opposite signs. Since x + 2 > x −2 it must be the case that x + 2 > 0 and x −2 < 0, which gives us that −2 < x < 2. Combining this with y > 0, we conclude (x, y) ∈B, as desired. 62\n\n (⊇) Let (x, y) ∈B be arbitrary and fixed. Then y > 0 and −2 < x < 2, so (x −2)(x + 2) < 0. We want r > 0 such that y < −r 4(x −2)(x + 2). Scratch Work: y < −r 4(x −2)(x + 2) ⇐⇒ − 4y (x −2)(x + 2) < r We know there must exist a positive real number greater than − 4y (x −2)(x + 2). We use this to continue the proof. Fix any r > − 4y (x −2)(x + 2). We observe that since y > 0, (x−2)(x+2) < 0, and − 4y (x −2)(x + 2) < r it must be the case that y < −r 4(x−2)(x+2). Thus we have (x, y) ∈R2 and 0 < y < −r 4(x −2)(x + 2), and therefore (x, y) ∈Ar. By definition of an indexed union, (x, y) ∈ S r∈R+ Ar, as desired. Since we have shown both containments, it follows that [ r∈R+ Ar = B. Exercise 9.1.7. Consider the following sets and determine whether the statements in (a)-(n) are True or False. A = {z ∈Z | −3 ≤z ≤3}, B = {y ∈Z | −5 < y < 6}, C = {x ∈R | x2 ≥9}, D = {x ∈R | x < −3}, E = {n ∈N | (∃k ∈N)(n = 2k)}.

Prove that for all sets A and B, A × B = B × A if and only if A = ∅ or B = ∅or A = B. Exercise 9.1.9.

(b) Prove that A△B = ∅if and only if A = B. Exercise 9.1.10. For each of the following, either prove the statement using a set containment proof or disprove it by constructing a counterexample. (a) Prove or disprove: For any sets A, B, and C, (A ∪B) ∖C ⊆(A ∖(B ∪C)) ∪(B ∖(A ∪C)). (b) Prove or disprove: For any sets A, B, and C, (A ∖(B ∪C)) ∪(B ∖(A ∪C)) ⊆(A ∪B) ∖C. 9.1.3. Set Equality via Logical Equivalences Set equality can always be viewed as a biconditional statement, which is why double containment proofs and biconditional proofs share a similar structure. Let U be a universal set containing two sets A and B. Then the statement A = B can be written symbolically as ∀x ∈U, (x ∈A ↔x ∈B). Recall that one way to prove a biconditional statement is by constructing a chain of logical equivalences. This method can also be applied to sets. It is particularly useful when the proof relies on definitions, algebraic manipulations, or previously established biconditional results. However, it is important to recognize that this approach may not be suitable for all proofs, especially those that require more nuanced or intricate reasoning beyond straightforward equivalences. Before we do an example, we first need a lemma that will serve as a useful intermediary result. 64", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

{"instruction": "State and prove the following theorem.", "input": "Corollary 30.1.2", "output": "**Corollary:** Let m ∈Z+ and a ∈Z be relatively prime to m. If n ∈Z+ satisfies an ≡1 (mod m), then a−1 ≡an−1 (mod m). The theorem guarantees that whenever a is relatively prime to m, there exists some positive integer n for which an ≡1 (mod m). We now define the smallest such n. 187\n\n**Proof:** Let P(n) be a predicate defined on n ∈N such that: 1. P(0) holds, and 2. ∀k ∈N, (P(k) →P(k + 1)) holds. Define a set S ⊆N as follows: S = {n ∈N | P(n)}. We wish to show that S = N. Since S ⊆N by definition, it suffices to show that N ⊆S. By assumption (1), P(0) holds, so 0 ∈S. By assumption (2), S is closed under the successor function: for all k ∈N, if k ∈S, then k + 1 ∈S. Thus, S contains 0 and is 69\n\n closed under successors. By the definition of N as the smallest set with these properties, it follows that N ⊆S. Therefore, S = N by double containment. Hence, P(n) holds for all n ∈N. While this proof appears to require induction starting at n = 0, the following corollary shows that we may begin at any integer M. Corollary 10.1.2 (Corollary to PMI). Let M ∈Z and S = {z ∈Z | z ≥M}. Further, let P(n) be a predicate defined on S such that 1. P(M) holds 2. ∀k ∈S, (P(k) →P(k + 1)) holds Then ∀n ∈S, P(n) holds. Proof. Let P(n) be as above, and define a new predicate Q(n) on n ∈N by Q(n) ⇔P(n + M) From (1), P(M) holds, so Q(0) holds. Now assume Q(k) holds for some k ∈N. Then P(k + M) holds. Since k + M ∈S, assumption (2) implies P(k + M + 1) holds, hence Q(k + 1) holds. Thus, Q(n) satisfies the two conditions of induction. By PMI, Q(n) holds for all n ∈N. Finally, let n ∈S be arbitrary. Then n−M ∈N, so Q(n−M) holds. By definition of Q, this means P(n) holds. Since n ∈S was arbitrary, we conclude ∀n ∈S, P(n) holds. PMI Template Let M ∈Z and S = {n ∈Z | n ≥M}. Claim: ∀n ∈S, P(n) is true. Proof : We proceed by induction on n ∈S. • Base Case: n = M. Prove that P(M) holds. • Inductive Hypothesis: Assume n ∈S and P(n) holds. • Inductive Step: Use the assumption that P(n) holds to prove that P(n + 1) holds. By the principle of mathematical induction, ∀n ∈S, P(n) holds. Before we move on to our first example, let us make a couple of notes on summations and products. Statements involving summations and products are often proved by induction, since both are defined recursively. 70\n\n • For n ∈Z+, the sum of real numbers a1, a2, . . . , an, denoted Pn i=1 ai, is defined recursively as follows: ▶ 0P i=1 ai = 0 ▶ n+1 P i=1 ai = \u0012 nP i=1 ai \u0013 + an+1 For example: 4 X i=1 (i2 + 1) = (12 + 1) + (22 + 1) + (32 + 1) + (42 + 1) = 34 • For n ∈Z+, the product of real numbers a1, a2, . . . , an, denoted Qn i=1 ai, is defined recursively as follows: ▶ 0Q i=1 ai = 1 ▶ n+1 Q i=1 ai = \u0012 nQ i=1 ai \u0013 · an+1 For example: 4 Y i=1 (i2 + 1) = (12 + 1) · (22 + 1) · (32 + 1) · (42 + 1) = 1700 10.1.1. Examples We are now ready to begin working through examples. Example 10.1.3. For n ∈Z+, the nth triangular number, Tn, is defined as the sum of the first n consecutive positive integers. That is, Tn = n X i=1 i = 1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + n. We would like to find a closed-form expression for Tn. First, let us compute a few examples to look for a pattern: • T1 = 1 • T2 = 1 + 2 = 3 • T3 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 = 4 + 2 71\n\n • T4 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 = 5 + 5 • T5 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 = 6 + 6 + 3 • T6 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21 = 7 + 7 + 7 • T100 = 1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + 100 = 101 + · · · + 101 | {z } 50 times • T101 = 1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + 101 = 102 + · · · + 102 | {z } 50 times +51 These suggest the following observations: • If n is even, we can pair terms so that each pair sums to n + 1. Since there are n 2 such pairs, n X i=1 i = (n + 1) \u0010n 2 \u0011 = n(n + 1) 2 . • If n is odd, we can again pair terms so that each pair sums to n + 1, leaving the middle term n + 1 2 unpaired. Therefore, n X i=1 i = (n + 1) \u0012n −1 2 \u0013 + n + 1 2 = n(n + 1) 2 . In both cases, we obtain the same closed-form expression. This motivates the following proposition. Claim: For all n ∈Z+, n X i=1 i = n(n + 1) 2 . Proof. We proceed by induction on n ∈Z+. • Base Case: For n = 1, 1 X i=1 i = 1 = 1(1 + 1) 2 . Thus the base case holds. • Inductive Step: Assume for some k ∈Z+ that k X i=1 i = k(k + 1) 2 . (This is the inductive hypothesis.) 72\n\n We must show k+1 X i=1 i = (k + 1)(k + 2) 2 . Observe the following chain of equalities: k+1 X i=1 i = k X i=1 i ! + (k + 1) = k(k + 1) 2 + (k + 1) (by the inductive hypothesis) = k(k + 1) + 2(k + 1) 2 = (k + 1)(k + 2) 2 . By the Principle of Mathematical Induction, it follows that n X i=1 i = n(n + 1) 2 for all n ∈Z+. Exercise 10.1.4. Prove that for every n ∈Z+, the following holds: n X i=1 i3 = \u0012n(n + 1) 2 \u00132 . Exercise 10.1.5. For each part below, determine the set of natural numbers for which the property holds true, and prove your claim. (a) 2n ≥(n + 1)2 (b) 3n+1 > n4 (c) n3 + (n + 1)3 > (n + 2)3 (d) 3n ≥2n+1 73\n\n 11. September 19 11.1. Principle of Mathematical Induction 11.1.1. Examples Example 11.1.1. We will consider the sum of consecutive *odd* integers. Let’s draw some pictures and make some observations. If we keep adding consecutive odd numbers, will we always get a square? It sure looks like it, but a preponderance of evidence is not sufficient justification. It’s possible that this pattern falls apart for some larger values of n. However, from our geometric description, we can see that using our observation that 1 block makes a 1×1 square, we showed that 1+3 blocks make a 2×2 square. From there, we were able to show that 1+3+5 blocks can form a 3 × 3 square. Since we used the previous case being true to show that the next case is true, this seems to lend itself to induction. Claim: For all n ∈Z+, nP i=1 (2i −1) = n2. Proof. We proceed by induction on n ∈Z+. • Base Case: If n = 1, then 1 X i=1 (2i −1) = 1 = 12, as desired. • Inductive Step: Let k ∈Z+ and assume kP i=1 (2i −1) = k2 (this is our Inductive Hypothesis). Then we have the following chain of equalities: 74\n\n k+1 X i=1 (2i −1) = k X i=1 (2i −1) ! + (2(k + 1) −1) = k X i=1 (2i −1) ! + (2k + 1) = k2 + 2k + 1 (by the Inductive Hypothesis) = (k + 1)2. Hence, k+1 P i=1 (2i −1) = (k + 1)2, as desired. By the principle of mathematical induction, we conclude that nP i=1 (2i −1) = n2 for all n ∈Z+. 11.1.2. Sequences Definition. A sequence of real numbers is an enumerated collection of reals in which repetition and order matter. For now, we focus on sequences of real numbers, typically enumerated by either N or Z+. Notation: ⟨an⟩n∈N represents the sequence ⟨an⟩n∈N = ⟨a0, a1, a2, a3, . . .⟩, where each ai is a real number. a0 is the 0th term, a1 is the 1st term, etc. Similarly, ⟨an⟩n∈Z+ = ⟨a1, a2, a3, . . .⟩. More formally, a sequence can be thought of as a function f : N →R. We have not yet studied functions formally, so for now we treat this as an intuition. Often, sequences are defined recursively, which makes them particularly well-suited for proofs by induction. For example, recall the triangular numbers, ⟨Tn⟩n∈Z+, defined by Tn = 1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + n. We can also define this sequence recursively by specifying the initial term (the base case) and how each subsequent term is derived from the previous one (the recurrence relation): T1 = 1, Tn+1 = Tn + (n + 1). In this section, we will introduce two important sequences. 75\n\n The Factorial Sequence Definition. For n ∈N, we define n!, read “n factorial,” by n! = n Y i=1 i. Since product notation is itself defined recursively, this definition can also be rewritten as follows: 0! = 1 (n + 1)! = (n + 1) · n! For example, 5! = 5 · 4 · 3 · 2 · 1 = 120. Now let us look at an induction proof involving the factorial sequence. Example 11.1.2. For which values of n ∈N does the inequality n! > 2n hold? To answer this, we first examine small values of n: n 2n n! 0 1 1 1 2 1 2 4 2 3 8 6 4 16 24 5 32 120 6 64 720 From this table, we see that at n = 4, n! first exceeds 2n. Moreover, it appears that n! continues to grow faster than 2n thereafter. This suggests the following conjecture. Claim: For all integers n ≥4, we have n! > 2n. Proof. We proceed by induction on n ∈N with n ≥4. • Base Case: When n = 4, we compute 4! = 24 > 16 = 24, as required. 76\n\n • Inductive Step: Let k ∈N with k ≥4 and assume k! > 2k. We want to show (k + 1)! > 2k+1. Using the recursive definition of factorial, we compute: (k + 1)! = (k + 1) · k! (By Definition) > (k + 1) · 2k (By the Inductive Hypothesis) > 2 · 2k (Since k ≥4) = 2k+1. Thus, (k + 1)! > 2k+1, as desired. By the principle of mathematical induction, we conclude that n! > 2n for all integers n ≥4. Note. Notice that our proof did not address the values n = 0, 1, 2, 3, since the claim only concerned n ≥4. To check what happens at those smaller values, we had to verify them directly using the table. The induction proof neither proves nor disproves the inequality for n < 4; it simply establishes the result for all n ≥4. Exercise 11.1.3.

Problem: In order to prove that the claim holds for fn+1, we will need to refer not only to fn but also to fn−1. How can we handle this situation using the principle of mathematical induction? 77\n\n 11.1.3. Strong Induction Theorem 11.1.5 (Strong Principle of Mathematical Induction). Let P(n) be a predicate defined for all n ∈N. Suppose: 1. P(0) holds. 2. ∀k ∈N, ((∀i ∈[k] ∪{0}, P(i)) →P(k + 1)) holds. Then P(n) holds for all n ∈N. In other words, if P(0) is true and whenever P(0), P(1), . . . , P(n) are all true this implies P(n + 1) is true, then P(n) is true for all n ∈N. We will now prove the Strong Principle of Mathematical Induction using the ordinary Principle of Mathematical Induction. Proof. Let P(n) be a predicate defined for all n ∈N, satisfying conditions (1) and (2) of the theorem. Define a new proposition Q(n) for n ∈N by Q(n) := ∀i ∈[n] ∪{0}, P(i). We proceed by induction on n ∈N to show that Q(n) holds for all n ∈N. • Base Case: n = 0. By assumption (1), P(0) holds. By the definition of Q(n), we have Q(0) ≡P(0). Thus Q(0) holds. • Inductive Step: Let k ∈N and assume Q(k) holds (this is the inductive hypothesis). From the definition of Q(k), this means ∀i ∈[k] ∪{0}, P(i) holds. By condition (2), it follows that P(k + 1) holds. Therefore, ∀i ∈[k + 1] ∪{0}, P(i) holds, so Q(k + 1) holds. By the principle of mathematical induction, Q(n) holds for all n ∈N. Finally, to see that this implies ∀n ∈N, P(n): let n ∈N. Since Q(n) holds, we have ∀i ∈[n] ∪{0}, P(i). Because n ∈[n] ∪{0}, it follows that P(n) holds. Since n was arbitrary, ∀n ∈N, P(n) holds. Exercise 11.1.6. Let P(n) be a predicate defined on n ∈Z. For each case below, identify which instances of the proposition you could necessarily deduce. (a) Base Case: P(−3). Implication: ∀n ∈Z, (P(n) →P(n + 1)). (b) Base Case: P(1). Implication: ∀n ∈N, (P(n) →P(2n)). (c) Base Case: P(0). Implication: ∀n ∈Z, (P(n) →(P(n −1) ∧P(n + 1))). (d) Base Cases: P(−1) ∧P(0).

Implications: ∀n ∈Z, ((P(n) →P(n + 6)) ∧(P(2n) →P(n))). 78\n\n Template for Induction Proofs Using SPMI Let M ∈Z and define S = {n ∈Z | n ≥M}. Claim: ∀n ∈S, P(n). Proof : We proceed by strong induction on n ∈S. Base Case: Show P(M) holds because . . . There may be more base cases if necessary. Inductive Step: Let k ∈S such that P(i) holds for all i ∈S with M ≤i ≤k. Show P(k + 1) holds. If there are ℓmany base cases, assume k ≥M + ℓ. By the strong principle of mathematical induction, we conclude that ∀n ∈S, P(n) holds. Notice that in the template we allow for multiple base cases, even though the theorem itself does not explicitly mention this. Multiple base cases arise when the truth of P(k + 1) is completely independent of the truth of P(0), P(1), . . . , P(k), so there is no causality linking these earlier terms to P(k+1). In such situations, we must verify the first several values directly. Eventually, however, the sequence becomes causal, meaning that each term depends on previous ones, at which point strong induction can be applied. Before returning to Example 11.1.4, we will first examine the historically significant induction problem that necessitated the use of the strong inductive hypothesis. To do so, we first need to formally define a prime number. Definition. • A natural number n is called prime if and only if n > 1 and its only positive divisors are 1 and n. • A natural number n is called composite if and only if n > 1 and n is not prime. That is, there exists a, b ∈N with 1 < a ≤b < n such that n = ab. For instance, the first 10 prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29 79\n\n In the chapter on number theory, we will discuss prime numbers in much more depth. For now, the important idea is that prime numbers are the basic building blocks of the natural numbers (and, in fact, the integers as well). Our first strong induction proof is the first half of an important result in number theory, the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Theorem 11.1.7 (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, Part 1). For all n ∈N with n > 1, n is either prime or a product of primes. Proof. We proceed by strong induction on the integers n ≥2. Define P(n) to be the proposition that “n is either prime or a product of primes.” • Base Case: n = 2. The number 2 is prime since the only possible positive divisors are 1 and 2, which both divide 2. Thus, P(2) holds. • Inductive Step: Let k ∈N with k ≥2 and assume P(i) holds for all i ∈N with 2 ≤i ≤k. Consider n = k + 1. We break this into two cases: ▶Case 1: If k + 1 is prime, then P(k + 1) holds, as desired. ▶Case 2: If k + 1 is not prime, then there exist p, q ∈N with 2 ≤p ≤q ≤k such that k + 1 = pq. Fix such p and q. By the inductive hypothesis, both p and q are either prime or a product of primes. Thus, for some a, b ∈Z+, p = a Y i=1 pi, q = b Y j=1 qj where the pi’s and qj’s are primes. Therefore, k + 1 = a Y i=1 pi !  b Y j=1 qj  , which shows that k + 1 is a product of primes. Hence P(k + 1) holds. By the strong principle of mathematical induction, P(n) holds for all integers n ≥2. 80\n\n 12. September 24 12.1. Principle of Mathematical Induction 12.1.1. Strong Induction To see another variety of a strong induction proof, let us now revisit Example 11.1.4. Example 12.1.1. Claim: For all n ∈N, fn < 2n. We will have two base cases for this proof for two reasons. First, f0 and f1 are defined independently of the previous terms, so the truth value of fn < 2n will need to be manually verified for these terms. Secondly, since fn is defined in terms of the previous two terms for n ≥2, we will need to know that the inequality holds for two consecutive terms in order to apply the (strong) inductive hypothesis. Proof. We proceed by strong induction on n ∈N. • Base Cases: We verify that the inequality holds for n = 0 and n = 1. ▶n = 0. f0 = 0 < 1 = 20, as desired. ▶n = 1. f1 = 1 < 2 = 21, as desired. • Inductive Step: Let k ∈N with k ≥1, and assume that fi < 2i for all i ∈Z with 0 ≤i ≤k. We want to show fk+1 < 2k+1. fk+1 = fk + fk−1 (by definition, since k + 1 ≥2) < 2k + 2k−1 (by IH) = 2k−1(2 + 1) = 2k−1 · 3 < 2k−1 · 22 = 2k+1 Therefore, fk+1 < 2k+1, as desired.

We now define the smallest such n. 187", "input": "", "output": "Let P(n) be a predicate defined on n ∈N such that: 1. P(0) holds, and 2. ∀k ∈N, (P(k) →P(k + 1)) holds. Define a set S ⊆N as follows: S = {n ∈N | P(n)}. We wish to show that S = N. Since S ⊆N by definition, it suffices to show that N ⊆S. By assumption (1), P(0) holds, so 0 ∈S. By assumption (2), S is closed under the successor function: for all k ∈N, if k ∈S, then k + 1 ∈S. Thus, S contains 0 and is 69\n\n closed under successors. By the definition of N as the smallest set with these properties, it follows that N ⊆S. Therefore, S = N by double containment. Hence, P(n) holds for all n ∈N. While this proof appears to require induction starting at n = 0, the following corollary shows that we may begin at any integer M. Corollary 10.1.2 (Corollary to PMI). Let M ∈Z and S = {z ∈Z | z ≥M}. Further, let P(n) be a predicate defined on S such that 1. P(M) holds 2. ∀k ∈S, (P(k) →P(k + 1)) holds Then ∀n ∈S, P(n) holds. Proof. Let P(n) be as above, and define a new predicate Q(n) on n ∈N by Q(n) ⇔P(n + M) From (1), P(M) holds, so Q(0) holds. Now assume Q(k) holds for some k ∈N. Then P(k + M) holds. Since k + M ∈S, assumption (2) implies P(k + M + 1) holds, hence Q(k + 1) holds. Thus, Q(n) satisfies the two conditions of induction. By PMI, Q(n) holds for all n ∈N. Finally, let n ∈S be arbitrary. Then n−M ∈N, so Q(n−M) holds. By definition of Q, this means P(n) holds. Since n ∈S was arbitrary, we conclude ∀n ∈S, P(n) holds. PMI Template Let M ∈Z and S = {n ∈Z | n ≥M}. Claim: ∀n ∈S, P(n) is true. Proof : We proceed by induction on n ∈S. • Base Case: n = M. Prove that P(M) holds. • Inductive Hypothesis: Assume n ∈S and P(n) holds. • Inductive Step: Use the assumption that P(n) holds to prove that P(n + 1) holds. By the principle of mathematical induction, ∀n ∈S, P(n) holds. Before we move on to our first example, let us make a couple of notes on summations and products. Statements involving summations and products are often proved by induction, since both are defined recursively. 70\n\n • For n ∈Z+, the sum of real numbers a1, a2, . . . , an, denoted Pn i=1 ai, is defined recursively as follows: ▶ 0P i=1 ai = 0 ▶ n+1 P i=1 ai = \u0012 nP i=1 ai \u0013 + an+1 For example: 4 X i=1 (i2 + 1) = (12 + 1) + (22 + 1) + (32 + 1) + (42 + 1) = 34 • For n ∈Z+, the product of real numbers a1, a2, . . . , an, denoted Qn i=1 ai, is defined recursively as follows: ▶ 0Q i=1 ai = 1 ▶ n+1 Q i=1 ai = \u0012 nQ i=1 ai \u0013 · an+1 For example: 4 Y i=1 (i2 + 1) = (12 + 1) · (22 + 1) · (32 + 1) · (42 + 1) = 1700 10.1.1. Examples We are now ready to begin working through examples. Example 10.1.3. For n ∈Z+, the nth triangular number, Tn, is defined as the sum of the first n consecutive positive integers. That is, Tn = n X i=1 i = 1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + n. We would like to find a closed-form expression for Tn. First, let us compute a few examples to look for a pattern: • T1 = 1 • T2 = 1 + 2 = 3 • T3 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 = 4 + 2 71\n\n • T4 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 = 5 + 5 • T5 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 = 6 + 6 + 3 • T6 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21 = 7 + 7 + 7 • T100 = 1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + 100 = 101 + · · · + 101 | {z } 50 times • T101 = 1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + 101 = 102 + · · · + 102 | {z } 50 times +51 These suggest the following observations: • If n is even, we can pair terms so that each pair sums to n + 1. Since there are n 2 such pairs, n X i=1 i = (n + 1) \u0010n 2 \u0011 = n(n + 1) 2 . • If n is odd, we can again pair terms so that each pair sums to n + 1, leaving the middle term n + 1 2 unpaired. Therefore, n X i=1 i = (n + 1) \u0012n −1 2 \u0013 + n + 1 2 = n(n + 1) 2 . In both cases, we obtain the same closed-form expression. This motivates the following proposition. Claim: For all n ∈Z+, n X i=1 i = n(n + 1) 2 . Proof. We proceed by induction on n ∈Z+. • Base Case: For n = 1, 1 X i=1 i = 1 = 1(1 + 1) 2 . Thus the base case holds. • Inductive Step: Assume for some k ∈Z+ that k X i=1 i = k(k + 1) 2 . (This is the inductive hypothesis.) 72\n\n We must show k+1 X i=1 i = (k + 1)(k + 2) 2 . Observe the following chain of equalities: k+1 X i=1 i = k X i=1 i ! + (k + 1) = k(k + 1) 2 + (k + 1) (by the inductive hypothesis) = k(k + 1) + 2(k + 1) 2 = (k + 1)(k + 2) 2 . By the Principle of Mathematical Induction, it follows that n X i=1 i = n(n + 1) 2 for all n ∈Z+. Exercise 10.1.4. Prove that for every n ∈Z+, the following holds: n X i=1 i3 = \u0012n(n + 1) 2 \u00132 . Exercise 10.1.5. For each part below, determine the set of natural numbers for which the property holds true, and prove your claim. (a) 2n ≥(n + 1)2 (b) 3n+1 > n4 (c) n3 + (n + 1)3 > (n + 2)3 (d) 3n ≥2n+1 73\n\n 11. September 19 11.1. Principle of Mathematical Induction 11.1.1. Examples Example 11.1.1. We will consider the sum of consecutive *odd* integers. Let’s draw some pictures and make some observations. If we keep adding consecutive odd numbers, will we always get a square? It sure looks like it, but a preponderance of evidence is not sufficient justification. It’s possible that this pattern falls apart for some larger values of n. However, from our geometric description, we can see that using our observation that 1 block makes a 1×1 square, we showed that 1+3 blocks make a 2×2 square. From there, we were able to show that 1+3+5 blocks can form a 3 × 3 square. Since we used the previous case being true to show that the next case is true, this seems to lend itself to induction. Claim: For all n ∈Z+, nP i=1 (2i −1) = n2. Proof. We proceed by induction on n ∈Z+. • Base Case: If n = 1, then 1 X i=1 (2i −1) = 1 = 12, as desired. • Inductive Step: Let k ∈Z+ and assume kP i=1 (2i −1) = k2 (this is our Inductive Hypothesis). Then we have the following chain of equalities: 74\n\n k+1 X i=1 (2i −1) = k X i=1 (2i −1) ! + (2(k + 1) −1) = k X i=1 (2i −1) ! + (2k + 1) = k2 + 2k + 1 (by the Inductive Hypothesis) = (k + 1)2. Hence, k+1 P i=1 (2i −1) = (k + 1)2, as desired. By the principle of mathematical induction, we conclude that nP i=1 (2i −1) = n2 for all n ∈Z+. 11.1.2. Sequences Definition. A sequence of real numbers is an enumerated collection of reals in which repetition and order matter. For now, we focus on sequences of real numbers, typically enumerated by either N or Z+. Notation: ⟨an⟩n∈N represents the sequence ⟨an⟩n∈N = ⟨a0, a1, a2, a3, . . .⟩, where each ai is a real number. a0 is the 0th term, a1 is the 1st term, etc. Similarly, ⟨an⟩n∈Z+ = ⟨a1, a2, a3, . . .⟩. More formally, a sequence can be thought of as a function f : N →R. We have not yet studied functions formally, so for now we treat this as an intuition. Often, sequences are defined recursively, which makes them particularly well-suited for proofs by induction. For example, recall the triangular numbers, ⟨Tn⟩n∈Z+, defined by Tn = 1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + n. We can also define this sequence recursively by specifying the initial term (the base case) and how each subsequent term is derived from the previous one (the recurrence relation): T1 = 1, Tn+1 = Tn + (n + 1). In this section, we will introduce two important sequences. 75\n\n The Factorial Sequence Definition. For n ∈N, we define n!, read “n factorial,” by n! = n Y i=1 i. Since product notation is itself defined recursively, this definition can also be rewritten as follows: 0! = 1 (n + 1)! = (n + 1) · n! For example, 5! = 5 · 4 · 3 · 2 · 1 = 120. Now let us look at an induction proof involving the factorial sequence. Example 11.1.2. For which values of n ∈N does the inequality n! > 2n hold? To answer this, we first examine small values of n: n 2n n! 0 1 1 1 2 1 2 4 2 3 8 6 4 16 24 5 32 120 6 64 720 From this table, we see that at n = 4, n! first exceeds 2n. Moreover, it appears that n! continues to grow faster than 2n thereafter. This suggests the following conjecture. Claim: For all integers n ≥4, we have n! > 2n. Proof. We proceed by induction on n ∈N with n ≥4. • Base Case: When n = 4, we compute 4! = 24 > 16 = 24, as required. 76\n\n • Inductive Step: Let k ∈N with k ≥4 and assume k! > 2k. We want to show (k + 1)! > 2k+1. Using the recursive definition of factorial, we compute: (k + 1)! = (k + 1) · k! (By Definition) > (k + 1) · 2k (By the Inductive Hypothesis) > 2 · 2k (Since k ≥4) = 2k+1. Thus, (k + 1)! > 2k+1, as desired. By the principle of mathematical induction, we conclude that n! > 2n for all integers n ≥4. Note. Notice that our proof did not address the values n = 0, 1, 2, 3, since the claim only concerned n ≥4. To check what happens at those smaller values, we had to verify them directly using the table. The induction proof neither proves nor disproves the inequality for n < 4; it simply establishes the result for all n ≥4. Exercise 11.1.3. Prove that for all positive integers n, n X k=1 k (k + 1)! = 1 − 1 (n + 1)! The Fibonacci Sequence Definition. For n ∈N, we define the nth Fibonacci number, fn, recursively by fn =      0 if n = 0, 1 if n = 1, fn−1 + fn−2 if n ≥2. The first several Fibonacci numbers are: ⟨fn⟩n∈N = ⟨0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, . . .⟩. Example 11.1.4. Prove that fn < 2n for all n ∈N. Problem: In order to prove that the claim holds for fn+1, we will need to refer not only to fn but also to fn−1. How can we handle this situation using the principle of mathematical induction? 77\n\n 11.1.3. Strong Induction Theorem 11.1.5 (Strong Principle of Mathematical Induction). Let P(n) be a predicate defined for all n ∈N. Suppose: 1. P(0) holds. 2. ∀k ∈N, ((∀i ∈[k] ∪{0}, P(i)) →P(k + 1)) holds. Then P(n) holds for all n ∈N. In other words, if P(0) is true and whenever P(0), P(1), . . . , P(n) are all true this implies P(n + 1) is true, then P(n) is true for all n ∈N.

We proceed by induction on n ∈N to show that Q(n) holds for all n ∈N. • Base Case: n = 0. By assumption (1), P(0) holds. By the definition of Q(n), we have Q(0) ≡P(0). Thus Q(0) holds. • Inductive Step: Let k ∈N and assume Q(k) holds (this is the inductive hypothesis). From the definition of Q(k), this means ∀i ∈[k] ∪{0}, P(i) holds. By condition (2), it follows that P(k + 1) holds. Therefore, ∀i ∈[k + 1] ∪{0}, P(i) holds, so Q(k + 1) holds. By the principle of mathematical induction, Q(n) holds for all n ∈N. Finally, to see that this implies ∀n ∈N, P(n): let n ∈N. Since Q(n) holds, we have ∀i ∈[n] ∪{0}, P(i). Because n ∈[n] ∪{0}, it follows that P(n) holds. Since n was arbitrary, ∀n ∈N, P(n) holds.

Proof : We proceed by strong induction on n ∈S. Base Case: Show P(M) holds because . . . There may be more base cases if necessary. Inductive Step: Let k ∈S such that P(i) holds for all i ∈S with M ≤i ≤k. Show P(k + 1) holds. If there are ℓmany base cases, assume k ≥M + ℓ. By the strong principle of mathematical induction, we conclude that ∀n ∈S, P(n) holds. Notice that in the template we allow for multiple base cases, even though the theorem itself does not explicitly mention this.

We proceed by strong induction on n ∈N. • Base Cases: We verify that the inequality holds for n = 0 and n = 1. ▶n = 0. f0 = 0 < 1 = 20, as desired. ▶n = 1. f1 = 1 < 2 = 21, as desired. • Inductive Step: Let k ∈N with k ≥1, and assume that fi < 2i for all i ∈Z with 0 ≤i ≤k. We want to show fk+1 < 2k+1. fk+1 = fk + fk−1 (by definition, since k + 1 ≥2) < 2k + 2k−1 (by IH) = 2k−1(2 + 1) = 2k−1 · 3 < 2k−1 · 22 = 2k+1 Therefore, fk+1 < 2k+1, as desired. By the strong principle of mathematical induction, we conclude that fn < 2n for all n ∈N. 81", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

Base Case: n = 0. Since 0 is the least natural number, any subset of N containing 0 has a least element. Thus P(0) holds. 83\n\n Inductive Step: Let k ∈N and assume P(i) holds for all natural numbers i with 0 ≤i ≤k. Now consider n = k + 1, and let S ⊆N with k + 1 ∈S. • If S has no element less than k + 1, then k + 1 is the least element in S. • If S contains an element i ≤k, then by inductive hypothesis, we know P(i) holds. Hence S has a least element. Since these are the only two possibilities, P(k + 1) holds. By the strong principle of mathematical induction, P(n) holds for all n ∈N.

Corollary 12.1.8. For M ∈Z, if S = {x ∈Z | x ≥M}, then S is well-ordered. We’ll see two main uses for the Well-Ordering Property. WOP as Part of a Larger Proof In number theory and other fields of discrete mathematics, it is common to use the Well-Ordering Property (the existence of a least element satisfying the proposition) as a step in a larger proof. We’ll use it here to finally complete the proof of the Division Algorithm. Theorem 12.1.9 (Division Algorithm). Let a, b ∈Z with b > 0. Then there exist unique q, r ∈Z such that a = bq + r with 0 ≤r < b. We have already shown that if such q and r exist, then they are unique (see the proof of Theorem 3.1.1). It remains to show that q and r always exist. Existence. Define S ⊆N as follows: S = {n ∈N | ∃k ∈Z, (n = a −bk)}. For any integer k ≤a b, we have a −bk ≥0, so S ̸= ∅. By the Well-Ordering Property, there exists a least element r ∈S. Fix r. Then, by definition of S, we have r = a −bq for some q ∈Z. Fix q as well. We want to show that these are our desired values of q and r from the statement of the theorem. Since r ∈S ⊆N, we know r ≥0. It remains to show that r < b. 84\n\n Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that r ≥b. Then r−b ≥0. Substituting r = a−bq, we compute: r −b = a −bq −b = a −b(q + 1) ≥0. This implies that r −b ∈S, contradicting our assumption that r was the least element of S. Hence, a = bq + r with 0 ≤r < b. Therefore, there exist q, r ∈Z such that a = bq + r with 0 ≤r < b, as desired. 85\n\n 13. September 26 13.1. Principle of Mathematical Induction 13.1.1. Well-Ordered Sets Proof by Infinite Descent The other major application of the Well-Ordering Property is a variant of induction known as a proof by infinite descent. One consequence of the Well-Ordering Property is that there is no infinite descending sequence of natural numbers. In a proof by infinite descent, we assume, for the sake of contradiction, that the claim fails for some n ∈N. We then show that it must also fail for a smaller value m ∈N. Iterating this process would yield an infinite descending sequence of natural numbers, contradicting the Well-Ordering Property. There are many different ways of phrasing infinite descent arguments, but below we present one outline of how such a proof may proceed. Template for Infinite Descent Proofs Claim: ∀n ∈N, P(n) Proof : Assume for the sake of contradiction (AFSOC) that ∃n ∈N such that ¬P(n) holds. Let n ∈N be the least natural number such that ¬P(n) holds (which exists by the WOP). Show that ∃k ∈N with k < n such that ¬P(k) holds. This contradicts our assumption. Therefore, by the Well-Ordering Property, ∀n ∈N, P(n) holds. Example 13.1.1. Claim: √ 2 is irrational. Proof. To prove that √ 2 is irrational, it suffices to show that √ 2 ̸= m n for all m, n ∈Z+. Define the predicate P(n) on n ∈Z+ by P(n) := ∀m ∈Z+, ( √ 2 ̸= m n ). 86\n\n Our goal is to show that ∀n ∈Z+, P(n) holds. Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that ∃n ∈Z+ such that ¬P(n) holds. Fix n ∈Z+ as the least such that ¬P(n) holds, which exists by the Well-Ordering Property. Since ¬P(n) holds, there exists m ∈Z+ such that √ 2 = m n . Fix such an m. Squaring both sides of the equation and rearranging gives 2n2 = m2. Thus m2 is even. By Proposition 7.1.1, m is even, so m = 2m′ for some m′ ∈Z+. Fix m′. Substituting back, we obtain 2n2 = 4(m′)2 ⇒ n2 = 2(m′)2. This implies n2 is even, and hence n is even. Therefore n = 2n′ for some n′ ∈Z+. Fix n′. Since n = 2n′ and n′ < n, we have found a smaller denominator. Substituting back, we get √ 2 = m n = 2m′ 2n′ = m′ n′ . Thus ¬P(n′) holds, contradicting the minimality of n. Therefore, our assumption was false, and P(n) holds for all n ∈Z+. Hence √ 2 is irrational. Exercise 13.1.2. Prove that 3√ 3 must be irrational. 87\n\n Part III. Functions and Relations 88\n\n 14. September 26 14.1. Binary Relations In this section, we will explore the concept of a binary relation between two sets (often just called a relation). The idea of a relation between two sets is already familiar to you. A binary relation allows us to compare or link elements from two sets. For instance, when we say 2 < 3, we are comparing two elements from Z. Similarly, when we say “Bill takes a class with Professor Johnson,” we are linking an element from the set of students with an element from the set of professors. We formalize this idea by defining a binary relation as a subset of the Cartesian product of the two sets being linked. Definition. Let S and T be sets. • If R ⊆S ×T, then R is called a binary relation between S and T. If (a, b) ∈R, we say that “a is in relation to b,” sometimes denoted aRb. • S is called the domain of R, and T is called the codomain of R. Many of the common relations in mathematics (and in other contexts) are relations where both elements belong to the same set (i.e., S = T). In that case, we simply say that R is a relation on S, meaning that R ⊆S × S. We begin by examining examples of binary relations, some linking elements of different sets, and others connecting elements of the same set. Examples 14.1.1. 1. Let S be the set of students at CMU and T be the set of professors at CMU. We define a relation R ⊆S × T such that (s, t) ∈R if and only if s has taken a class with t. That is, R = {(s, t) ∈S × T | s has taken a class with t}. For any given pair (s, t) of student and professor, we can determine whether s has taken a class with t by checking if (s, t) ∈R. 89\n\n 2. The standard ordering relation < is a relation on sets such as R, Q, Z, and N. We can express this comparison as a set of ordered pairs. For instance, for x, y ∈R, we have x < y iff (x, y) ∈{(a, b) ∈R2 | ∃c ∈R+, (a + c = b)}. 3. The divisibility relation on the integers is another common example. Recall that for m, n ∈Z, we say that m | n if and only if there exists k ∈Z such that m·k = n. This relation can be viewed as the set of ordered pairs Rd: Rd = {(m, n) ∈Z2 | ∃k ∈Z, (m · k = n)}. 4. The subset relation ⊆is another familiar example. Let S be a set. We define the binary relation of ⊆on P(S) (the power set of S) such that for any A, B ∈P(S), the following holds: A ⊆B iff ∀x ∈S, (x ∈A →x ∈B). We can also express this relation as the set of ordered pairs, Rs: Rs = {(A, B) ∈P(S) × P(S) | ∀x ∈S, (x ∈A →x ∈B)}. 5. Functions are another important type of binary relation. For instance, the function f(x) = x2, defined for x ∈R, is a relation that links elements of R with other elements of R. The function f can be represented as the set of ordered pairs in R2 that satisfy the condition y = x2. In other words, the function f is given by: f = {(x, y) ∈R2 | y = x2}. This set is commonly referred to as the graph of f. 6. Equality is perhaps the most common binary relation on any set. For any set S, equality can be expressed as the set of ordered pairs for which the first and second components are identical: Re = {(a, a) ∈S × S | a ∈S}. Exercise 14.1.2. Let S = {1, 2, 3}. (a) How many different binary relations on S exist? (b) What is the binary relation on S with the fewest number of elements? (c) What is the binary relation on S with the most number of elements? 90\n\n 14.2. Functions Recall how a function was first introduced to you in earlier courses. Was it presented as a “rule” mapping elements from one set to another? Was it defined as a curve in R2 that passes the vertical line test? What if there is no explicit rule for defining the mapping? Must a function be something that we can graph in R2? Formally, a function is a relation that is more general than these definitions. Definition. Let A and B be sets, and let f be a binary relation between A and B. We say that f is a function from A to B, denoted f : A →B, if and only if for each a ∈A, there exists a unique b ∈B such that (a, b) ∈f. Notation: We write f(a) = b to mean that (a, b) ∈f. Recall that for any relation R ⊆A × B, we say that A is the domain of R and B is the codomain of R. This terminology is most commonly used when f is a function. If f : A →B is a function, then A is the domain of f and B is the codomain of f. Examples 14.2.1. 1. Let S be any set. We define the identity function on S, denoted IdS or simply Id if the domain is clear from context, by IdS : S →S such that for all x ∈S, IdS(x) = x. That is, the identity function maps each element to itself. Equivalently, we can write IdS as the set of ordered pairs: IdS = {(x, x) | x ∈S}. 2. Define the function f : R+ →R by f(x) = √x for any x ∈R+. Then f is a function and can be expressed formally as: f = {(a, b) ∈R+ × R | a = b2 ∧b > 0}. 3. Let A = {x, y, z}. Define g : A →N by: g = {(x, 1), (y, 10), (z, 42)}. Note that there is no requirement for a specific pattern in the mapping, even if the domain is infinite. We do not need to explicitly write a rule defining the mapping for it to be a function. We simply need to ensure that for each a ∈A, there is a unique b ∈B such that (a, b) ∈g. 91\n\n Non-Examples 14.2.2. The following proposed “functions” are ill-defined: 1. Suppose you define a mapping f : R →R by f(x) = 1 x. f is not defined over the entire domain. In particular, f(0) is undefined. 2. Suppose you define a mapping g : N →N by g(n) = √n. While g(n) is defined for each n ∈N, the output does not always belong to the codomain N. For example, g(2) = √ 2 /∈N. 3. Suppose you define a mapping h : Q →Z by h \u0010 p q \u0011 = p + q. h is not well-defined because it fails to satisfy the uniqueness condition. For instance, 1 2 = 2 4, but h \u0000 1 2 \u0001 = 3 while h \u0000 2 4 \u0001 = 6. 92\n\n 15. September 29 15.1. Functions As seen in the previous non-examples, we can be given a rule for a mapping f : A →B, and it may not be clear whether or not it is a function. For this reason, we introduce the terminology of a well-defined function. A well-defined function is simply a binary relation that satisfies the definition of a function. However, it is worth emphasizing this point, as we are often given “rules” for mappings rather than explicit sets of ordered pairs. Definition. A mapping f : A →B is a well-defined function iff f satisfies the following conditions: 1. (Totality) For all a ∈A, f(a) is defined. (That is, A is the domain of f.) 2. (Existence) For all a ∈A, f(a) ∈B. (That is, f maps each element of A to an element of B, so B is the codomain.) 3. (Uniqueness) For all a ∈A, f(a) must be uniquely defined. (That is, for each a ∈A, there is a unique element in B corresponding to a.) Condition 3 may seem obvious, but it becomes important in cases where the domain consists of multiple representations of the same element (such as 1 2 and 2 4), or when the mapping is defined piecewise. Exercise 15.1.1. Determine which of the following maps are well-defined functions. (a) f : Q →Q defined by f \u0000 m n \u0001 = m+n n2 (b) g : Q →Q defined by g \u0000 m n \u0001 = 2m+n 2n (c) h : R →R defined by h(x) = x2−1 x2+1 (d) j : R →R defined by j(x) = x2+1 x2−1 (e) k : N →N defined by k(n) =      n 2 if n is even n 3 if 3 | n n otherwise 93\n\n (f) ℓ: N →N defined by ℓ(n) =      n−1 2 if n is odd n 2 if 4 | n n otherwise Because a function is simply a set of ordered pairs, the equality of two functions follows directly from the definition of equality for sets. Theorem 15.1.2 (Function Equality). Let A and B be sets, and let f : A →B and g : A →B be functions. Then f = g if and only if ∀a ∈A, f(a) = g(a). Exercise 15.1.3. Prove the above theorem. The important point is that two functions are considered equal not based on how they are defined, but on their behavior: they must yield the same output for every element in the domain, regardless of how their rules are expressed. Example 15.1.4. Let A = {1, 2, 3}. Define f : A →Z by f(x) = x3 −x2 −6 and g : A →Z by g(x) = 5x2 −11x. At first glance, f and g seem to be different functions because they have different defining expressions. However, since A has only three elements, we can manually verify that f and g give the same output for every element in A: f = {(1, −6), (2, −2), (3, 12)} = g Therefore, f and g are indeed equal despite their differing rules. You may have noticed that we have not used the word “range” when discussing functions. This is because the term “range” can be ambiguous: some use it to mean the codomain (the set of potential outputs), while others use it to mean the set of actual outputs. To avoid this ambiguity, we will not use the term “range.” Instead, we use the term image when referring to the set of actual outputs, as defined below. 15.1.1. Images and Preimages Definition. Let A and B be sets, and let f : A →B be a function. For any subset X ⊆A, the image of X under f, denoted by Imf(X), is defined as: Imf(X) = {b ∈B | ∃a ∈X, (f(a) = b)} . If X = A, we refer to this as the image of f. 94", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

For this reason, we introduce the terminology of a well-defined function. A well-defined function is simply a binary relation that satisfies the definition of a function. However, it is worth emphasizing this point, as we are often given “rules” for mappings rather than explicit sets of ordered pairs. Definition. A mapping f : A →B is a well-defined function iff f satisfies the following conditions: 1. (Totality) For all a ∈A, f(a) is defined. (That is, A is the domain of f.) 2. (Existence) For all a ∈A, f(a) ∈B. (That is, f maps each element of A to an element of B, so B is the codomain.) 3. (Uniqueness) For all a ∈A, f(a) must be uniquely defined. (That is, for each a ∈A, there is a unique element in B corresponding to a.) Condition 3 may seem obvious, but it becomes important in cases where the domain consists of multiple representations of the same element (such as 1 2 and 2 4), or when the mapping is defined piecewise. Exercise 15.1.1. Determine which of the following maps are well-defined functions. (a) f : Q →Q defined by f \u0000 m n \u0001 = m+n n2 (b) g : Q →Q defined by g \u0000 m n \u0001 = 2m+n 2n (c) h : R →R defined by h(x) = x2−1 x2+1 (d) j : R →R defined by j(x) = x2+1 x2−1 (e) k : N →N defined by k(n) =      n 2 if n is even n 3 if 3 | n n otherwise 93\n\n (f) ℓ: N →N defined by ℓ(n) =      n−1 2 if n is odd n 2 if 4 | n n otherwise Because a function is simply a set of ordered pairs, the equality of two functions follows directly from the definition of equality for sets. Theorem 15.1.2 (Function Equality). Let A and B be sets, and let f : A →B and g : A →B be functions. Then f = g if and only if ∀a ∈A, f(a) = g(a). Exercise 15.1.3. Prove the above theorem. The important point is that two functions are considered equal not based on how they are defined, but on their behavior: they must yield the same output for every element in the domain, regardless of how their rules are expressed. Example 15.1.4. Let A = {1, 2, 3}. Define f : A →Z by f(x) = x3 −x2 −6 and g : A →Z by g(x) = 5x2 −11x. At first glance, f and g seem to be different functions because they have different defining expressions. However, since A has only three elements, we can manually verify that f and g give the same output for every element in A: f = {(1, −6), (2, −2), (3, 12)} = g Therefore, f and g are indeed equal despite their differing rules. You may have noticed that we have not used the word “range” when discussing functions. This is because the term “range” can be ambiguous: some use it to mean the codomain (the set of potential outputs), while others use it to mean the set of actual outputs. To avoid this ambiguity, we will not use the term “range.” Instead, we use the term image when referring to the set of actual outputs, as defined below. 15.1.1. Images and Preimages Definition. Let A and B be sets, and let f : A →B be a function. For any subset X ⊆A, the image of X under f, denoted by Imf(X), is defined as: Imf(X) = {b ∈B | ∃a ∈X, (f(a) = b)} . If X = A, we refer to this as the image of f. 94", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

If k, ℓ∈Z satisfy ak ≡1 (mod m) and aℓ≡1 (mod m), then k ≡ℓ(mod m). Example 29.1.11. Find all x ∈Z such that 4x ≡5 (mod 7). First, note that 4 is invertible modulo 7 since gcd(4, 7) = 1. We find that 4−1 ≡2 (mod 7) because 4 · 2 = 8 ≡1 (mod 7). Now, let x ∈Z satisfy 4x ≡5 (mod 7). Multiplying both sides by 2 gives 2 · 4x ≡2 · 5 (mod 7). Simplifying, we obtain x ≡3 (mod 7). Therefore, the set of solutions is {x ∈Z | 4x ≡5 (mod 7)} = [3]7. The following corollary characterizes when a linear congruence modulo m has a solution.\n\n**Proof:** Let y ∈Imf(S ∩T) be arbitrary. By the definition of the image, there exists some x ∈S ∩T such that f(x) = y. Fix such an x. By the definition of intersection, we have x ∈S and x ∈T. Since y = f(x) and x ∈S, it follows that y ∈Imf(S). Similarly, since x ∈T, we also have y ∈Imf(T). Thus, y ∈Imf(S) ∩Imf(T), as desired. Since y was arbitrary, we conclude that Imf(S ∩T) ⊆Imf(S) ∩Imf(T). Exercise 15.1.7. Show that the reverse containment does not always hold. Similar to the definition of an image, we have the concept of a preimage (also called the inverse image). The image of a set is the set of outputs corresponding to inputs from the original set. Similarly, the preimage of a subset of the codomain is the set of inputs that yield those outputs (if any). We formalize this idea below. Definition. Let A and B be sets, and let f : A →B be a function. For any subset Y ⊆B, the preimage of Y under f, denoted PreImf(Y ), is defined as: PreImf(Y ) = {a ∈A | f(a) ∈Y } Note. Since A is the domain of f, it always holds that PreImf(B) = A. Example 15.1.8. Consider again the function f : R →R defined by f(x) = x2. Then: PreImf(R) = R, PreImf([0, ∞)) = R, PreImf({1, 4}) = {±1, ±2}, PreImf({1, −4}) = {±1}, PreImf([−1, 4]) = [−2, 2]. 95\n\n Proposition 15.1.9. Let A and B be sets, and let f : A →B be a function. For any S, T ∈P(B), we have PreImf(S ∩T) = PreImf(S) ∩PreImf(T) Proof. Let S, T ∈P(B) and a ∈A be arbitrary. Then a ∈PreImf(S ∩T) ⇐⇒ f(a) ∈S ∩T (definition of preimage) ⇐⇒ f(a) ∈S ∧f(a) ∈T (definition of intersection) ⇐⇒ a ∈PreImf(S) ∧a ∈PreImf(T) (definition of preimage) ⇐⇒ a ∈PreImf(S) ∩PreImf(T) (definition of intersection).

PreImf(Y1 ∖Y2) = PreImf(Y1) ∖PreImf(Y2) 15.1.2. Jections We now introduce a few special (and important!) types of functions: surjections, injections, and bijections. Injections Definition. Let A and B be sets, and let f : A →B be a function. We say that f is injective (or one-to-one) if and only if for all x, y ∈A, if f(x) = f(y), then x = y. 96\n\n Standard Injectivity Proof Outline • Let x, y ∈A such that f(x) = f(y). • Use the definition of f and other assumptions to show that x = y. • Conclude that f is injective. Let’s begin with a simple example to illustrate this concept. Example 15.1.12. Define f : R →R by f(x) = 5x + 6. Prove that f is an injection. Proof. Let x, y ∈R such that f(x) = f(y). Then: 5x + 6 = 5y + 6. Subtracting 6 from both sides, we get 5x = 5y. Dividing both sides by 5 gives: x = y. Therefore, f is injective. In early algebra courses, we often say that a function f : R →R is injective if and only if it “passes the horizontal line test.” This means that any horizontal line drawn in the Cartesian plane will intersect the graph of the function at most once. In the case of the function f(x) = 5x + 6, the graph passes the horizontal line test, as shown on the right. A function fails the horizontal line test if there are two distinct values of x that correspond to the same value of y. 97\n\n 16. October 1 16.1. Functions 16.1.1. Jections Injections We now look at a function where the definition splits into two cases depending on whether the input is positive or not. Example 16.1.1. Define a function f : Z →N by f(n) = ( 2n −1 if n > 0, −2n if n ≤0. Claim: f is injective. Proof. Let x, y ∈Z such that f(x) = f(y). We will consider three cases: (1) both x and y are positive, (2) both x and y are nonpositive, and (3) one is positive and the other is non-positive. • Case 1: Suppose x, y > 0. In this case, f(x) = f(y) implies 2x −1 = 2y −1. By adding 1 to both sides, we get 2x = 2y, and dividing by 2, we obtain x = y. • Case 2: Suppose x, y ≤0. Here, f(x) = f(y) implies −2x = −2y. Dividing both sides by −2, we get x = y. • Case 3: Without loss of generality, assume x > 0 and y ≤0. Then, f(x) = f(y) implies 2x −1 = −2y. Rearranging this, we have 2x + 2y = 1, or equivalently, x + y = 1 2. However, x + y ∈Z, while 1 2 /∈Z, a contradiction. Hence, this case is not possible. Since in all cases we either have x = y or a contradiction, we conclude that f(x) = f(y) implies x = y for all x, y ∈Z. Therefore, f is injective. Remark. It is important not to forget the third case where one input is positive and the other is non-positive. Although it might feel like the first two cases should cover 98\n\n everything, the mixed case is precisely where we need to argue that no equality is possible. Without this check, the proof would be incomplete. Disproving Injectivity To show that a function f : A →B is not injective, it is enough to find distinct elements x, y ∈A such that f(x) = f(y). This kind of argument is usually a simple proof by demonstration. Example 16.1.2. As a contrast, let us examine a function that fails to be injective. Define f : Z2 →Z by f(x, y) = x + y. Claim: f is not an injection. Proof. Consider (0, 0), (1, −1) ∈Z2. Since (0, 0) ̸= (1, −1) but f(0, 0) = 0 = f(1, −1), we have found two distinct inputs with the same output. Therefore f is not an injection. Exercise 16.1.3. Determine whether or not the following functions are injections. (a) f : R2 →R2 such that f(x, y) = (3x + 4y, 2x + y). (b) g : R3 →R2 such that f(x, y, z) = (xz, yz). (c) h : R →R such that h(x) = ( x3 + 3x2 + 3x if x ≤0 5 −2x if x > 0 (d) j : N2 →Z such that j(a, b) = ( b if a = 0 −2a−1(2b + 1) if a > 0 Recall the result from recitation that every positive integer can be expressed uniquely as a power of 2 times an odd number. Surjections Definition. Let A and B be sets, and let f : A →B be a function. We say f is surjective (or onto) if and only if Imf(A) = B. That is, ∀b ∈B, ∃a ∈A such that f(a) = b. 99\n\n Standard Surjectivity Proof Outline • Let b ∈B be arbitrary and fixed. • Show that there exists a ∈A such that f(a) = b. (This is often done by explicitly constructing such an a.) • Conclude that f is surjective. Notice that surjectivity focuses on whether every element of the codomain is “hit” by the function. As a first illustration, let’s revisit the function from Example 16.1.2. Although it failed to be injective, we will see that it is surjective. Example 16.1.4. Define f : Z2 →Z by f(m, n) = m + n. Claim: f is a surjection. Proof. Let y ∈Z be arbitrary. We want to show that there exists (m, n) ∈Z2 such that f(m, n) = y. Consider (y, 0) ∈Z2. Then f(y, 0) = y + 0 = y. Since y was arbitrary, this proves that f is surjective. Example 16.1.5. Let f : Q →Q be defined by f(x) = 1 + 2x. Claim: f is a surjection. Proof. Let y ∈Q. Then y = m n for some m, n ∈Z with n ̸= 0. Fix such m and n. To find x such that f(x) = y, we need to solve 1 + 2x = m n . Rearranging the equation, we get x = m −n 2n . Since m and n are integers with n ̸= 0, it follows that x = m −n 2n ∈Q. Then f \u0012m −n 2n \u0013 = 1 + 2 · m −n 2n = 1 + m −n n = n + (m −n) n = m n = y. Since y ∈Q was arbitrary, we conclude that f is surjective. Next, let us revisit the function from Example 16.1.1. Earlier we showed it was injective; here we will prove that it is also surjective. This means the function actually turns out to be a bijection, though we will make that terminology precise later. 100", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

The Problem with Division We have established that addition, subtraction, and multiplication are well-defined operations modulo m, but division remains problematic. The following examples illustrate why: • If 2x ≡1 (mod m), we cannot conclude that x ≡ 1 2 (mod m), since 1 2 /∈Z, and congruences modulo m are defined only over integers. (Recall that it is an equivalence relation on Z.) • If 6x ≡21 (mod m), we cannot divide both sides by 3 directly. For example, 6 ≡21 (mod 15), but 2 ̸≡7 (mod 15). However, we do have 2 ≡7 (mod 15 3 ). 181\n\n The next theorem clarifies how certain forms of division can still be managed within modular arithmetic.\n\n**Proof:** Let y ∈N be arbitrary. We consider two cases: when y is even and when y is odd. • Case 1: Suppose y is even. Then y = 2k for some k ∈N. Consider x = −k. Since −k ≤0, we have f(x) = f(−k) = −2(−k) = 2k = y. • Case 2: Suppose y is odd. Then y = 2k+1 for some k ∈N. Consider x = k+1 ∈Z. Since k + 1 > 0, we have f(x) = f(k + 1) = 2(k + 1) −1 = 2k + 1 = y. Since we have addressed both possibilities, we conclude that f is surjective. Disproving Surjectivity A function f : A →B is not surjective if and only if there exists an element b ∈B such that f(a) ̸= b for all a ∈A. In other words, to disprove surjectivity it suffices to find a single element in the codomain that is not in the image of f. Example 16.1.7. Let f : R →R be defined by f(x) = x+|x| 2 . Claim: f is not a surjection. Proof. Consider y = −1 ∈R. Assume for the sake of contradiction that there exists x ∈R such that f(x) = −1. Then: x + |x| 2 = −1. We consider two cases based on the value of x: • Case 1: Suppose x ≥0. Then |x|= x, and the equation becomes x + x 2 = −1 =⇒2x 2 = −1 =⇒x = −1. But this contradicts our assumption that x ≥0. 101\n\n • Case 2: Suppose x < 0. Then |x|= −x, and the equation becomes x −x 2 = −1 =⇒0 2 = −1 =⇒0 = −1, which is a contradiction. Since both cases lead to a contradiction, there is no x ∈R such that f(x) = −1. Thus, −1 is not in the image of f, and f is not surjective. Exercise 16.1.8.

The Problem with Division We have established that addition, subtraction, and multiplication are well-defined operations modulo m, but division remains problematic. The following examples illustrate why: • If 2x ≡1 (mod m), we cannot conclude that x ≡ 1 2 (mod m), since 1 2 /∈Z, and congruences modulo m are defined only over integers. (Recall that it is an equivalence relation on Z.) • If 6x ≡21 (mod m), we cannot divide both sides by 3 directly. For example, 6 ≡21 (mod 15), but 2 ̸≡7 (mod 15). However, we do have 2 ≡7 (mod 15 3 ). 181\n\n The next theorem clarifies how certain forms of division can still be managed within modular arithmetic.", "input": "", "output": "Let y ∈N be arbitrary. We consider two cases: when y is even and when y is odd. • Case 1: Suppose y is even. Then y = 2k for some k ∈N. Consider x = −k.

Since we have addressed both possibilities, we conclude that f is surjective. Disproving Surjectivity A function f : A →B is not surjective if and only if there exists an element b ∈B such that f(a) ̸= b for all a ∈A. In other words, to disprove surjectivity it suffices to find a single element in the codomain that is not in the image of f. Example 16.1.7. Let f : R →R be defined by f(x) = x+|x| 2 . Claim: f is not a surjection. Proof. Consider y = −1 ∈R. Assume for the sake of contradiction that there exists x ∈R such that f(x) = −1. Then: x + |x| 2 = −1. We consider two cases based on the value of x: • Case 1: Suppose x ≥0. Then |x|= x, and the equation becomes x + x 2 = −1 =⇒2x 2 = −1 =⇒x = −1. But this contradicts our assumption that x ≥0. 101\n\n • Case 2: Suppose x < 0. Then |x|= −x, and the equation becomes x −x 2 = −1 =⇒0 2 = −1 =⇒0 = −1, which is a contradiction. Since both cases lead to a contradiction, there is no x ∈R such that f(x) = −1. Thus, −1 is not in the image of f, and f is not surjective. Exercise 16.1.8.

The set {0, 1, . . . , m−1} is an example of what we call a complete set of residues modulo m.\n\n**Proof:** Let y ∈R be arbitrary. Consider x = y −6 5 ∈R. Then f \u0012y −6 5 \u0013 = 5 \u0012y −6 5 \u0013 + 6 = y. Therefore, f maps onto all of R, proving that f is surjective. Since f is both injective and surjective, it follows that f is a bijection. In both examples, we established bijectivity by separately proving injectivity and surjectivity. This two-part process is the standard way to show that a function is a bijection. We now formalize it into a general strategy. Proving Bijectivity – Method 1 To prove that a function f : X →Y is a bijection, you need to: • Prove that f is an injection (i.e., for all x1, x2 ∈X, if f(x1) = f(x2) then x1 = x2). • Prove that f is a surjection (i.e., for every y ∈Y , there exists x ∈X such that f(x) = y). Example 16.1.11. Define f : R →R by f(x) =    1 x −1, if x < 1, √x −1, if x ≥1. Claim: f is a bijection. Proof. We will prove that f is both injective and surjective. • Injectivity: Let x1, x2 ∈R such that f(x1) = f(x2). We consider three cases: Case 1: Assume x1, x2 < 1. Then 1 x1 −1 = 1 x2 −1. Rearranging gives x1 −1 = x2 −1, so x1 = x2, as required. Case 2: Assume x1, x2 ≥1. Then √ x1 −1 = √ x2 −1. Squaring both sides yields x1 −1 = x2 −1, so x1 = x2. 103\n\n Case 3: Without loss of generality, assume x1 < 1 and x2 ≥1. Then f(x1) = 1 x1 −1 < 0, f(x2) = √ x2 −1 ≥0. Since a negative number cannot equal a nonnegative number, this contradicts the assumption that f(x1) = f(x2). Since all cases either forced x1 = x2 or led to a contradiction, we conclude that f is injective. • Surjectivity: Let y ∈R. We want to show there exists x ∈R such that f(x) = y. We split into two cases: Case 1: Suppose y < 0. Define x = 1 y + 1. Since y ̸= 0 and y < 0, it follows that x < 1. Then f(x) = f \u00121 y + 1 \u0013 = 1 1 y + 1 −1 = 1 1 y = y. Case 2: Suppose y ≥0. Define x = y2 + 1. Since y2 ≥0, we have x ≥1. Then f(x) = f(y2 + 1) = p y2 + 1 −1 = p y2 = |y|= y, where the last equality holds because y ≥0. In both cases, we have found an x ∈R such that f(x) = y. Therefore, f is surjective. Since f is both injective and surjective, we conclude that f is a bijection.

Composition and Inverses of Functions Before introducing a second method for proving bijectivity, we first need to define the operation of composing functions. Definition. Let A, B, and C be sets, and let f : A →B and g : B →C be functions. The composition of g and f is the function h : A →C defined by h(a) = g(f(a)) for all a ∈A. We denote this by h = g ◦f. An important property of function composition is that it is associative. Theorem 16.1.13 (Associativity of Composition). Let A, B, C, and D be sets, and let f : A →B, g : B →C, and h : C →D be functions. Then h ◦(g ◦f) = (h ◦g) ◦f. Proof. Let a ∈A. Then (h ◦(g ◦f))(a) = h((g ◦f)(a)) = h(g(f(a))) = (h ◦g)(f(a)) = ((h ◦g) ◦f)(a). Since a ∈A was arbitrary, we conclude that h ◦(g ◦f) = (h ◦g) ◦f. Note. Let f : A →B. Then IdB ◦f = f and f ◦IdA = f. In particular, if f : A →A, then IdA ◦f = f ◦IdA = f. This shows that the identity function is the identity element under the binary operation of composition. 105\n\n 17. October 3 17.1. Functions 17.1.1. Composition and Inverses of Functions The following theorem summarizes key properties of function composition with respect to injections, surjections, and bijections. Theorem 17.1.1. Let A, B, and C be sets, and let f : A →B and g : B →C be functions. Then the following properties hold: 1 If f and g are injections, then g ◦f : A →C is also an injection. 2 If f and g are surjections, then g ◦f : A →C is also a surjection. 3 If f and g are bijections, then g ◦f : A →C is also a bijection. Proof. 1 Assume that f : A →B and g : B →C are injections. We will show that g ◦f : A →C is injective. Let a1, a2 ∈A such that (g ◦f)(a1) = (g ◦f)(a2). By the definition of composition, this gives: g(f(a1)) = g(f(a2)). Since g is injective, we conclude: f(a1) = f(a2). And since f is injective, it follows that a1 = a2. Therefore, g ◦f is injective. 2 The proof that g ◦f is surjective is left as an exercise for recitation. 3 Since g ◦f is both injective (by 1 ) and surjective (by 2 ), it is bijective. 106\n\n Inverses Now that we have defined function composition, we can introduce the concept of inverse functions and prove an important result about bijections. Definition. Let A and B be sets, and let f : A →B and g : B →A be functions. • g is called a left inverse of f if and only if g ◦f = IdA. • g is called a right inverse of f if and only if f ◦g = IdB. • g is called a (two-sided) inverse of f if and only if g is both a left and a right inverse. • f is invertible if and only if f has a two-sided inverse. Notation: If f is invertible, we denote its inverse function by f−1. While not every function is invertible, an important property of inverses is that if they exist, they are unique. Theorem 17.1.2 (Uniqueness of Inverses). Let A and B be sets, and let f : A →B be a function. If f is invertible, then its inverse function f−1 is unique. Proof. Let f : A →B be invertible. Suppose g : B →A and g′ : B →A are both inverses of f. We want to show that g = g′. Since g and g′ are inverses of f, we know: f ◦g = IdB, g ◦f = IdA, f ◦g′ = IdB, g′ ◦f = IdA. Let b ∈B be arbitrary. Then g(b) = (g ◦IdB)(b) = (g ◦(f ◦g′))(b) = ((g ◦f) ◦g′)(b) = (IdA ◦g′)(b) = g′(b). Thus, g(b) = g′(b) for all b ∈B, which shows g = g′. Therefore, the inverse of f is unique. We now establish our major result for this section. Theorem 17.1.3. Let A and B be sets, and let f : A →B be a function. Then f is invertible if and only if f is a bijection. Proof. 107\n\n (⇒): Suppose f is invertible. Then there exists a function g : B →A such that g ◦f = IdA and f ◦g = IdB. We show that f is a bijection. ▶Injective: Let a1, a2 ∈A with f(a1) = f(a2). Applying g to both sides gives g(f(a1)) = g(f(a2)). Since g ◦f = IdA, it follows that idA(a1) = IdA(a2) =⇒ a1 = a2. Hence f is injective. ▶Surjective: Let b ∈B be arbitrary. Define a = g(b) ∈A. Since f and g are inverses, we have f(a) = f(g(b)) = IdB(b) = b. Hence f is surjective. Thus f is both injective and surjective, so f is a bijection. (⇐): Suppose f is a bijection (i.e., injective and surjective). Define the relation g = {(b, a) ∈B × A | f(a) = b}. We show g is a function from B to A. Let b ∈B. Since f is surjective, there exists a ∈A such that f(a) = b, so (b, a) ∈g. To show uniqueness, suppose (b, a), (b, a′) ∈g. Then f(a) = b = f(a′). Since f is injective, a = a′. Thus each b ∈B corresponds to a unique a ∈A, so g is a function. By construction, f ◦g = IdB and g ◦f = IdA. Hence g is the inverse of f, so f is invertible. From this theorem, we obtain a second method for proving bijectivity. Proving Bijectivity – Method 2 To prove that f : A →B is a bijection, it suffices to show that f is invertible. • Construct the inverse function g : B →A and prove that it is well-defined. • Prove that f ◦g = IdB. • Prove that g ◦f = IdA. • Conclude that g = f−1 and hence f is a bijection. 108", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

If x1 = x2, then clearly 3x1 −2 x1 −1 = 3x2 −2 x2 −1 , so g(x1) = g(x2). To check that g(x) ∈S, we verify that g(x) ̸= 3 for all x ∈T: g(x) = 3 ⇐⇒ 3x −2 x −1 = 3 ⇐⇒ 3x −2 = 3x −3 ⇐⇒ −2 = −3, a contradiction.

Homogeneous Relations Now that we’ve explored functions as a special type of binary relation, we turn our attention to relations where the domain and codomain are the same set. These are called homogeneous relations. Such relations are especially important because many of the most familiar mathematical structures, such as orderings and equivalence relations, are defined in terms of simple properties like reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity. By studying these properties in isolation, we will see how they combine to give rise to these richer and more structured types of relations. Definition. Let R be a binary relation on a set S. Then R is called: • Reflexive iff ∀x ∈S, (x, x) ∈R (i.e., every element is related to itself). • Irreflexive iff ∀x ∈S, (x, x) /∈R (i.e., no element is related to itself). • Symmetric iff ∀x, y ∈S, ((x, y) ∈R →(y, x) ∈R). • Antisymmetric iff ∀x, y ∈S, (((x, y) ∈R ∧(y, x) ∈R) →x = y). • Transitive iff ∀x, y, z ∈S, (((x, y) ∈R ∧(y, z) ∈R) →(x, z) ∈R). • Total iff ∀x, y ∈S, (x ̸= y →((x, y) ∈R ∨(y, x) ∈R)) (i.e., any two distinct elements are comparable). Notes. • Irreflexivity vs. Reflexivity: Irreflexivity is not the opposite of reflexivity. Both are universal statements. The only time a relation can be both reflexive and irreflexive is when the set S is empty. However, many relations are neither reflexive nor irreflexive. • Symmetry vs. Antisymmetry: Antisymmetry is not the opposite of symmetry. These properties are not logical negations of one another. The only relations that are both symmetric and antisymmetric are subsets of the equality relation. However, many relations are neither symmetric nor antisymmetric. • Contrapositive in Antisymmetry: In some cases, the hypothesis of antisymmetry (both (x, y) and (y, x) being in R) may never hold. In such cases, it is useful 111\n\n to consider the contrapositive: if x ̸= y, then either (x, y) /∈R or (y, x) /∈R.

November 5 28.1. Prime Factorizations We now have the necessary tools to establish the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.\n\n**Proof:** 1. Homework 2. Let F = {Si}i∈I be a partition of S. Define a relation R on S by R = {(x, y) ∈S | ∃i ∈I, (x ∈Si ∧y ∈Si)}. We want to show that R is an equivalence relation and that S/R = F. First, we check reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity. • (R): Let x ∈S. Since F is a partition of S, we have S i∈I Si = S. Hence, x ∈Si for some i ∈I, by the definition of an indexed union. Fix such an i. Then x ∈Si implies that (x, x) ∈R, as desired. • (S): Let x, y ∈S such that (x, y) ∈R. Then, by definition of R, we have x ∈ Si ∧y ∈Si for some i ∈I. Fix such an i. Since conjunction is commutative, this implies y ∈Si ∧x ∈Si. Hence (y, x) ∈R, as desired. • (T): Let x, y, z ∈S such that (x, y), (y, z) ∈R. Then, by definition of R, there exists i ∈I such that x ∈Si ∧y ∈Si, and there exists j ∈I such that y ∈Sj ∧z ∈Sj. Fix such i and j. Since F is a partition of S and y ∈Si and y ∈Sj, it must be the case that Si = Sj (the pieces of a partition are either equal or disjoint). Thus, x ∈Si ∧z ∈Si, implying that (x, z) ∈R, as desired. Therefore, R is an equivalence relation on S. It remains to show S/R = F. We proceed by double containment. • (⊆): Let A ∈S/R. Then, by definition, A = [x]R for some x ∈S. Since F is a partition, x belongs to exactly one block Si ∈F. Then A = [x]R = {y ∈S | y ∈Si} = Si. Therefore, A ∈F, as desired. • (⊇): Let Si ∈F. Since F is a partition, Si ̸= ∅. Fix x ∈Si. By uniqueness of the partition blocks, Si is the only block of F containing x. Thus [x]R = {y ∈S | y ∈Si} = Si, so Si ∈S/R. By double containment, we conclude that S/R = F. The utility of equivalence relations extends beyond classification: they provide the foundation for many mathematical structures, such as quotient groups in group theory and partitions in topology. Recognizing and applying these concepts will deepen your understanding of advanced mathematics and the connections between its different areas. 119\n\n 19.1.3. (Optional) Formal Constructions of Z and Q Previously, we discussed how to construct the natural numbers (or a structure having the same properties as N) from the axioms of set theory. Now, with the power of equivalence relations, we can formally construct the integers and rational numbers. This approach allows us to define addition and multiplication on these sets in a way that is consistent with the operations we already take for granted. Constructing the Integers The natural numbers do not include additive inverses, so subtraction is not always possible within N. To address this, we will construct the integers by introducing formal differences. The guiding idea is that an ordered pair (a, b) ∈N2 represents the “formal difference” a −b. However, we must be careful: since subtraction is not defined in N, we cannot simply say (a, b) = (c, d) whenever a −b = c −d. Instead, we use the following property of N: Cancellation Law: If k + m = n + m then k = n. This motivates the following definition. Theorem 19.1.5. Define a relation ∼on N2 by (a, b) ∼(c, d) ⇐⇒ a + d = b + c. Then ∼is an equivalence relation on N2. Proof. To be completed in recitation. The quotient set N2/∼will represent our set of integers. Each equivalence class [(a, b)]∼ under this relation represents the integer corresponding to the formal difference a −b. For example, [(3, 1)]∼ represents 3 −1 = 2, [(2, 5)]∼ represents 2 −5 = −3. We now want to define addition and multiplication on N2/∼in a way that matches how these operations behave in Z. For instance, we want 2 + (−3) to correspond to [(3, 1)]∼+ [(2, 5)]∼, and the result should represent −1. Similarly, 2 · (−3) should correspond to [(3, 1)]∼· [(2, 5)]∼, 120\n\n and the result should represent −6. Motivated by these examples, we define our operations as follows. Definition. We define addition on N2/∼by [(a, b)]∼+ [(c, d)]∼= [(a + c, b + d)]∼, and multiplication by [(a, b)]∼· [(c, d)]∼= [(ac + bd, ad + bc)]∼. Recall that equivalence classes can be represented by multiple ordered pairs. For example, [(2, 0)]∼= [(3, 1)]∼= [(4, 2)]∼= · · · Our definitions above used specific representatives, so we must verify that the operations are well-defined. That is, the result does not depend on the choice of representative. Theorem 19.1.6. The operations defined above are well-defined. In particular, if (a, b) ∼(a′, b′) and (c, d) ∼(c′, d′), then: 1. (a + c, b + d) ∼(a′ + c′, b′ + d′), 2. (ac + bd, ad + bc) ∼(a′c′ + b′d′, a′d′ + b′c′). Equivalently, if [(a, b)]∼= [(a′, b′)]∼and [(c, d)]∼= [(c′, d′)]∼, then [(a, b)]∼+[(c, d)]∼= [(a′, b′)]∼+[(c′, d′)]∼ and [(a, b)]∼·[(c, d)]∼= [(a′, b′)]∼·[(c′, d′)]∼. Before proving this theorem, let’s explore an example. Example 19.1.7. Suppose we want to represent the sum 2 + 3. Using our definition of addition, we could write: [(2, 0)]∼+ [(3, 0)]∼= [(2 + 3, 0 + 0)]∼= [(5, 0)]∼, which represents the number 5, as expected. But we could also represent 2 and 3 differently: [(3, 1)]∼+ [(10, 7)]∼= [(3 + 10, 1 + 7)]∼= [(13, 8)]∼, which also represents the number 5. Our theorem states that no matter which representatives of 2 and 3 we choose, the sum will always represent 5. Similarly, for the product 2 · 3 = 6: [(2, 0)]∼· [(3, 0)]∼= [(6 + 0, 0 + 0)]∼= [(6, 0)]∼ 121\n\n represents 6, while [(3, 1)]∼· [(10, 7)]∼= [(30 + 7, 21 + 10)]∼= [(37, 31)]∼ also represents 6. This illustrates that multiplication, too, should be independent of the choice of representatives. We now proceed to prove the theorem. Proof. Let (a, b), (a′, b′), (c, d), (c′, d′) ∈N2 such that (a, b) ∼(a′, b′) and (c, d) ∼(c′, d′). 1. We want to show that (a + c, b + d) ∼(a′ + c′, b′ + d′). By assumption, a + b′ = b + a′ and c + d′ = d + c′. Adding these two equalities gives a + c + b′ + d′ = b + d + a′ + c′, which shows (a + c, b + d) ∼(a′ + c′, b′ + d′). Thus, addition is well-defined on Z. 2. We want to show that (ac + bd, ad + bc) ∼(a′c′ + b′d′, a′d′ + b′c′). As in the previous case, from our assumptions we have a + b′ = b + a′ and c + d′ = d + c′. Multiplying the first equality by c and d, and the second by a′ and b′, we obtain c(a + b′) = c(b + a′), d(a + b′) = d(b + a′), and a′(c + d′) = a′(d + c′), b′(c + d′) = b′(d + c′). Adding these four equalities together yields c(a+b′)+d(a+b′)+a′(c+d′)+b′(c+d′) = c(b+a′)+d(b+a′)+a′(d+c′)+b′(d+c′). Expanding both sides gives ac+bd+a′d′ +b′c′ +b′c+a′d+a′c+b′d = ad+bc+a′c′ +b′d′ +a′c+b′d+a′d+b′c. Cancelling the common terms on both sides, we are left with ac + bd + a′d′ + b′c′ = ad + bc + a′c′ + b′d′. 122\n\n This is exactly the condition that (ac + bd, ad + bc) ∼(a′c′ + b′d′, a′d′ + b′c′), as desired. Therefore multiplication is well-defined on Z. Remark. With these definitions of addition and multiplication, the set Z inherits many of the familiar properties we expect integers to satisfy: associativity, commutativity, distributivity, and the existence of additive identities and inverses. These follow from the corresponding properties in N, but require careful checking in this new framework. Exercise 19.1.8. Prove the following properties of Z using the equivalence class construction: (a) Show that the element [(a, a)]∼serves as the additive identity in Z. (b) Prove that for each [(a, b)]∼∈Z, the element [(b, a)]∼is its additive inverse. (c) Show that [(1, 0)]∼is the multiplicative identity in Z.

Define a relation R on S by R = {(x, y) ∈S | ∃i ∈I, (x ∈Si ∧y ∈Si)}. We want to show that R is an equivalence relation and that S/R = F. First, we check reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity. • (R): Let x ∈S. Since F is a partition of S, we have S i∈I Si = S. Hence, x ∈Si for some i ∈I, by the definition of an indexed union. Fix such an i. Then x ∈Si implies that (x, x) ∈R, as desired. • (S): Let x, y ∈S such that (x, y) ∈R. Then, by definition of R, we have x ∈ Si ∧y ∈Si for some i ∈I. Fix such an i. Since conjunction is commutative, this implies y ∈Si ∧x ∈Si. Hence (y, x) ∈R, as desired. • (T): Let x, y, z ∈S such that (x, y), (y, z) ∈R. Then, by definition of R, there exists i ∈I such that x ∈Si ∧y ∈Si, and there exists j ∈I such that y ∈Sj ∧z ∈Sj. Fix such i and j. Since F is a partition of S and y ∈Si and y ∈Sj, it must be the case that Si = Sj (the pieces of a partition are either equal or disjoint). Thus, x ∈Si ∧z ∈Si, implying that (x, z) ∈R, as desired. Therefore, R is an equivalence relation on S. It remains to show S/R = F. We proceed by double containment. • (⊆): Let A ∈S/R. Then, by definition, A = [x]R for some x ∈S. Since F is a partition, x belongs to exactly one block Si ∈F. Then A = [x]R = {y ∈S | y ∈Si} = Si. Therefore, A ∈F, as desired. • (⊇): Let Si ∈F. Since F is a partition, Si ̸= ∅. Fix x ∈Si. By uniqueness of the partition blocks, Si is the only block of F containing x. Thus [x]R = {y ∈S | y ∈Si} = Si, so Si ∈S/R. By double containment, we conclude that S/R = F. The utility of equivalence relations extends beyond classification: they provide the foundation for many mathematical structures, such as quotient groups in group theory and partitions in topology. Recognizing and applying these concepts will deepen your understanding of advanced mathematics and the connections between its different areas. 119\n\n 19.1.3. (Optional) Formal Constructions of Z and Q Previously, we discussed how to construct the natural numbers (or a structure having the same properties as N) from the axioms of set theory. Now, with the power of equivalence relations, we can formally construct the integers and rational numbers. This approach allows us to define addition and multiplication on these sets in a way that is consistent with the operations we already take for granted. Constructing the Integers The natural numbers do not include additive inverses, so subtraction is not always possible within N. To address this, we will construct the integers by introducing formal differences. The guiding idea is that an ordered pair (a, b) ∈N2 represents the “formal difference” a −b. However, we must be careful: since subtraction is not defined in N, we cannot simply say (a, b) = (c, d) whenever a −b = c −d. Instead, we use the following property of N: Cancellation Law: If k + m = n + m then k = n. This motivates the following definition. Theorem 19.1.5. Define a relation ∼on N2 by (a, b) ∼(c, d) ⇐⇒ a + d = b + c. Then ∼is an equivalence relation on N2. Proof. To be completed in recitation. The quotient set N2/∼will represent our set of integers. Each equivalence class [(a, b)]∼ under this relation represents the integer corresponding to the formal difference a −b. For example, [(3, 1)]∼ represents 3 −1 = 2, [(2, 5)]∼ represents 2 −5 = −3. We now want to define addition and multiplication on N2/∼in a way that matches how these operations behave in Z. For instance, we want 2 + (−3) to correspond to [(3, 1)]∼+ [(2, 5)]∼, and the result should represent −1. Similarly, 2 · (−3) should correspond to [(3, 1)]∼· [(2, 5)]∼, 120\n\n and the result should represent −6. Motivated by these examples, we define our operations as follows. Definition. We define addition on N2/∼by [(a, b)]∼+ [(c, d)]∼= [(a + c, b + d)]∼, and multiplication by [(a, b)]∼· [(c, d)]∼= [(ac + bd, ad + bc)]∼. Recall that equivalence classes can be represented by multiple ordered pairs. For example, [(2, 0)]∼= [(3, 1)]∼= [(4, 2)]∼= · · · Our definitions above used specific representatives, so we must verify that the operations are well-defined. That is, the result does not depend on the choice of representative. Theorem 19.1.6. The operations defined above are well-defined. In particular, if (a, b) ∼(a′, b′) and (c, d) ∼(c′, d′), then: 1. (a + c, b + d) ∼(a′ + c′, b′ + d′), 2. (ac + bd, ad + bc) ∼(a′c′ + b′d′, a′d′ + b′c′). Equivalently, if [(a, b)]∼= [(a′, b′)]∼and [(c, d)]∼= [(c′, d′)]∼, then [(a, b)]∼+[(c, d)]∼= [(a′, b′)]∼+[(c′, d′)]∼ and [(a, b)]∼·[(c, d)]∼= [(a′, b′)]∼·[(c′, d′)]∼. Before proving this theorem, let’s explore an example. Example 19.1.7. Suppose we want to represent the sum 2 + 3. Using our definition of addition, we could write: [(2, 0)]∼+ [(3, 0)]∼= [(2 + 3, 0 + 0)]∼= [(5, 0)]∼, which represents the number 5, as expected. But we could also represent 2 and 3 differently: [(3, 1)]∼+ [(10, 7)]∼= [(3 + 10, 1 + 7)]∼= [(13, 8)]∼, which also represents the number 5. Our theorem states that no matter which representatives of 2 and 3 we choose, the sum will always represent 5. Similarly, for the product 2 · 3 = 6: [(2, 0)]∼· [(3, 0)]∼= [(6 + 0, 0 + 0)]∼= [(6, 0)]∼ 121\n\n represents 6, while [(3, 1)]∼· [(10, 7)]∼= [(30 + 7, 21 + 10)]∼= [(37, 31)]∼ also represents 6. This illustrates that multiplication, too, should be independent of the choice of representatives. We now proceed to prove the theorem. Proof. Let (a, b), (a′, b′), (c, d), (c′, d′) ∈N2 such that (a, b) ∼(a′, b′) and (c, d) ∼(c′, d′). 1. We want to show that (a + c, b + d) ∼(a′ + c′, b′ + d′). By assumption, a + b′ = b + a′ and c + d′ = d + c′. Adding these two equalities gives a + c + b′ + d′ = b + d + a′ + c′, which shows (a + c, b + d) ∼(a′ + c′, b′ + d′). Thus, addition is well-defined on Z. 2. We want to show that (ac + bd, ad + bc) ∼(a′c′ + b′d′, a′d′ + b′c′). As in the previous case, from our assumptions we have a + b′ = b + a′ and c + d′ = d + c′. Multiplying the first equality by c and d, and the second by a′ and b′, we obtain c(a + b′) = c(b + a′), d(a + b′) = d(b + a′), and a′(c + d′) = a′(d + c′), b′(c + d′) = b′(d + c′). Adding these four equalities together yields c(a+b′)+d(a+b′)+a′(c+d′)+b′(c+d′) = c(b+a′)+d(b+a′)+a′(d+c′)+b′(d+c′). Expanding both sides gives ac+bd+a′d′ +b′c′ +b′c+a′d+a′c+b′d = ad+bc+a′c′ +b′d′ +a′c+b′d+a′d+b′c. Cancelling the common terms on both sides, we are left with ac + bd + a′d′ + b′c′ = ad + bc + a′c′ + b′d′. 122\n\n This is exactly the condition that (ac + bd, ad + bc) ∼(a′c′ + b′d′, a′d′ + b′c′), as desired. Therefore multiplication is well-defined on Z. Remark. With these definitions of addition and multiplication, the set Z inherits many of the familiar properties we expect integers to satisfy: associativity, commutativity, distributivity, and the existence of additive identities and inverses. These follow from the corresponding properties in N, but require careful checking in this new framework. Exercise 19.1.8. Prove the following properties of Z using the equivalence class construction: (a) Show that the element [(a, a)]∼serves as the additive identity in Z. (b) Prove that for each [(a, b)]∼∈Z, the element [(b, a)]∼is its additive inverse. (c) Show that [(1, 0)]∼is the multiplicative identity in Z. (d) Verify that addition and multiplication in Z are commutative. (e) Prove that multiplication distributes over addition. (f) Prove that Z has no zero divisors. That is, if [(a, b)]∼· [(c, d)]∼= [(0, 0)]∼then [(a, b)]∼= [(0, 0)]∼or [(c, d)]∼= [(0, 0)]∼. Constructing the Rationals Now that we have a formal definition of the integers, we can follow a similar path to construct the rational numbers. The integers do not always include multiplicative inverses, so we cannot define division in Z. Let Z∗= Z ∖{0}. We will define a relation on (a, b), (c, d) ∈Z × Z∗that matches how we informally think of equality of fractions, a b = c d, but avoids direct use of division. We rely on the fact that the integers have no zero divisors: a · b = 0 ⇐⇒a = 0 or b = 0. This motivates our definition. 123", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

This observation provides a straightforward (though inefficient) method for checking whether a natural number n is prime.\n\n**Proof:** Homework 6. The quotient set Z × Z∗/≃will represent our set of rational numbers. Each equivalence class [(a, b)]≃under this relation represents the rational number corresponding to the quotient a b . For example, [(−1, 2)]≃ represents −1 2, [(8, 4)]≃ represents 8 4 = 2. We now define addition and multiplication on Z × Z∗/≃in a way consistent with how these operations behave in Q. For instance, we want −1 2 + 2 to correspond to [(−1, 2)]≃+ [(8, 4)]≃, and the result should represent 3 2. Similarly, −1 2 · 2 should correspond to [(−1, 2)]≃· [(8, 4)]≃, and the result should represent −1. Motivated by these examples, we define our operations as follows. Definition. We define addition on Z × Z∗/≃by [(a, b)]≃+ [(c, d)]≃= [(ad + bc, bd)]≃, and multiplication by [(a, b)]≃· [(c, d)]≃= [(ac, bd)]≃. Let’s revisit our previous example. Example 19.1.10.

Using the representatives from before and our formal definition of addition and multiplication, 124\n\n we have [(−1, 2)]≃+ [(8, 4)]≃= [(−4 + 16, 8)]≃= [(12, 8)]≃= 12 8 = 3 2, [(−1, 2)]≃· [(8, 4)]≃= [(−8, 8)]≃= −8 8 = −1. If instead we had chosen [(2, −4)]≃to represent −1 2 and [(2, 1)]≃to represent 2, we should still get the same answers: [(2, −4)]≃+ [(2, 1)]≃= [(2 −8, −4)]≃= [(−6, −4)]≃= −6 −4 = 3 2, [(2, −4)]≃· [(2, 1)]≃= [(4, −4)]≃= 4 −4 = −1. An example alone is not a proof, but it does indicate that these operations are probably well-defined, as this theorem confirms. Theorem 19.1.11. The operations defined above are well-defined. In particular, if (a, b) ≃(a′, b′) and (c, d) ≃(c′, d′), then 1. (ad + bc, bd) ≃(a′d′ + b′c′, b′d′), 2. (ac, bd) ≃(a′c′, b′d′). The proof of this theorem is similar to the analogous theorem for the integers. We leave this as an exercise. Exercise 19.1.12. Prove the previous theorem. Be sure to use only properties of the integers when working with these expressions. We now have formal constructions of the integers and rationals, together with precise definitions of their arithmetic operations. Along the way we proved many basic properties that are often taken for granted. This illustrates the broader mathematical principle that rigorous proofs and deeper theory require precise, formal definitions from the ground up. 125\n\n 20. October 10 20.1. Homogeneous Relations 20.1.1. Order Relations An order relation is a relation that ranks elements of a set against one another. Order relations generalize the familiar concepts of <, ≤, and ⊆. Definition. • A relation R on a set S is called a partial order if and only if R is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive. • If R is a partial order on S, then (S, R) is called a partially ordered set (or poset). For example, (P(S), ⊆) (for any set S) and (R, ≤) are posets. • A relation R is called a strict partial order if and only if R is irreflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive. For example, (P(S), ⊊) and (R, <) are strict partial orders. • A relation R is called a total order (or linear order) if and only if it is a partial order in which every pair of elements of S is comparable under R. As mentioned above, (P(S), ⊆) and (R, ≤) are two of the most common partial orders. The definition of a partial order can thus be viewed as a generalization of these familiar examples. Let’s begin by proving that ⊆is a partial order on a power set. Example 20.1.1. Consider the relation ⊆on P(N). We will prove that ⊆is a partial order on P(N). Proof. We must show that ⊆is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive. • (R): Let X ∈P(N). For every n ∈N, if n ∈X, then n ∈X, trivially. Thus X ⊆X. • (AS): Let X, Y ∈P(N) such that X ⊆Y and Y ⊆X. y the definition of set equality, this implies X = Y . 126\n\n • (T): Let X, Y, Z ∈P(N) such that X ⊆Y and Y ⊆Z. Let x ∈X. Since X ⊆Y , we have x ∈Y ; and since Y ⊆Z, we have x ∈Z. Therefore X ⊆Z. Hence, (P(N), ⊆) is a poset. The relation ⊆also motivates the term partial order: it provides a partial ranking of elements in P(N), but not all elements are comparable. For instance, {1} ̸⊆{2} and {2} ̸⊆{1}. A partial order in which all pairs of elements are comparable is called a total order (or linear order). A standard example of a total order is (R, ≤), and a standard example of a strict total order is (R, <). By contrast, ⊆serves as the canonical example of a partial order that is not total. Example 20.1.2. Consider the set N2. How can we linearly order the elements of this set? A natural first attempt might be to define (a, b) ≺(c, d) iff a < c and b < d. However, while this defines a strict partial order, it fails to satisfy totality. For instance, (1, 2) ̸≺(2, 1) and (2, 1) ̸≺(1, 2). Instead, we can order the elements of N2 in the same way we alphabetize words: by comparing the first components and, if they are equal, comparing the second components. This is known as the lexicographic ordering of N2. (a, b) ≺(c, d) iff (a < c) ∨((a = c) ∧(b < d)). Claim. The relation ≺is a strict total order on N2. Proof. We show that ≺is irreflexive, antisymmetric, transitive, and total. • (IR): Let (a, b) ∈N2. Since neither a < a nor b < b holds, we have (a, b) ̸≺(a, b). • (AS): We will prove the contrapositive of the definition of antisymmetry. Let (a, b), (c, d) ∈N2 such that (a, b) ̸= (c, d). We want to show (a, b) ̸≺(c, d) or (c, d) ̸≺(a, b). Since (a, b) ̸= (c, d), either a ̸= c or b ̸= d. We consider the cases of a = c and a ̸= c. ▶Case 1: a ̸= c. Without loss of generality, we may assume that a < c. Then (c, d) ̸≺(a, b) since c ̸< a. ▶Case 2: a = c. Since (a, b) ̸= (c, d) and a = c, it must be the case that b ̸= d. Without loss of generality, we may assume that b < d. Then (c, d) ̸≺(a, b) since c = a but d ̸< b. 127\n\n Since these are the only two cases, we conclude that ≺is antisymmetric. • (TR): Let (a, b), (c, d), (e, f) ∈N2 such that (a, b) ≺(c, d) and (c, d) ≺(e, f). We must show that (a, b) ≺(e, f). From (a, b) ≺(c, d), we have a < c or (a = c ∧b < d); from (c, d) ≺(e, f), we have c < e or (c = e ∧d < f). Consider cases: ▶Case 1: a < e. Then (a, b) ≺(e, f) by definition. ▶Case 2: a = e. Then it must be the case that a = c = e. Since (a, b) ≺(c, d) and a = c, we have b < d. Similarly, since (c, d) ≺(e, f) and c = e, we have d < f. Therefore, since b < d and d < f, we have b < f. Thus, (a, b) ≺(e, f), as desired. Therefore ≺is transitive. • (TO): Let (a, b), (c, d) ∈N2 with (a, b) ̸= (c, d). Then either a ̸= c or b ̸= d. ▶If a ̸= c, then either a < c or c < a. In the first case (a, b) ≺(c, d), and in the second (c, d) ≺(a, b). ▶If a = c and b ̸= d, then either b < d or d < b. In the first case (a, b) ≺(c, d), and in the second (c, d) ≺(a, b). Hence every pair is comparable, so ≺is total. Therefore, (N2, ≺) is a strict total order. Exercise 20.1.3. Define a relation ⪯on N by m ⪯n iff m | n. (a) Prove that ⪯is a partial order on N. (b) Prove that ⪯is not a total order on N.

Introduction Informally, the cardinality of a set S, denoted |S|, is the number of elements in the set. For finite sets, this definition is straightforward. However, for infinite sets, it is not immediately clear how we can define the notion of two infinite sets having the same cardinality. Below are some initial questions we might consider: 1 How should we compare the sizes of sets? 2 What does it mean for two sets to have the same size? 3 Should all infinite sets be considered the same size? To motivate our exploration of Questions 1 and 2 , let’s begin with a simpler case. Simpler Question: How can we determine whether two finite sets have the same size? One possible answer is to count the elements in each set. However, this approach breaks down when the sets are infinite. A more flexible method is to pair the elements of the two sets. If we can match each element of set A with exactly one element of set B, with no elements left unmatched in either set, then the two sets must contain the same number of elements. Example 21.1.1. Let A = {w, x, y, z} and B = {♡, ♢, ♣, ♠}. w ↔ ♡ x ↔ ♢ y ↔ ♣ z ↔ ♠ What we are actually doing here is defining a bijection f : A →B. This idea extends naturally to sets of any size and leads to our formal definition of “having the same cardinality.” 131", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

Since neither a < a nor b < b holds, we have (a, b) ̸≺(a, b). • (AS): We will prove the contrapositive of the definition of antisymmetry. Let (a, b), (c, d) ∈N2 such that (a, b) ̸= (c, d). We want to show (a, b) ̸≺(c, d) or (c, d) ̸≺(a, b). Since (a, b) ̸= (c, d), either a ̸= c or b ̸= d. We consider the cases of a = c and a ̸= c. ▶Case 1: a ̸= c. Without loss of generality, we may assume that a < c. Then (c, d) ̸≺(a, b) since c ̸< a. ▶Case 2: a = c. Since (a, b) ̸= (c, d) and a = c, it must be the case that b ̸= d. Without loss of generality, we may assume that b < d. Then (c, d) ̸≺(a, b) since c = a but d ̸< b. 127\n\n Since these are the only two cases, we conclude that ≺is antisymmetric. • (TR): Let (a, b), (c, d), (e, f) ∈N2 such that (a, b) ≺(c, d) and (c, d) ≺(e, f). We must show that (a, b) ≺(e, f). From (a, b) ≺(c, d), we have a < c or (a = c ∧b < d); from (c, d) ≺(e, f), we have c < e or (c = e ∧d < f). Consider cases: ▶Case 1: a < e. Then (a, b) ≺(e, f) by definition. ▶Case 2: a = e. Then it must be the case that a = c = e. Since (a, b) ≺(c, d) and a = c, we have b < d. Similarly, since (c, d) ≺(e, f) and c = e, we have d < f. Therefore, since b < d and d < f, we have b < f. Thus, (a, b) ≺(e, f), as desired. Therefore ≺is transitive. • (TO): Let (a, b), (c, d) ∈N2 with (a, b) ̸= (c, d). Then either a ̸= c or b ̸= d. ▶If a ̸= c, then either a < c or c < a. In the first case (a, b) ≺(c, d), and in the second (c, d) ≺(a, b). ▶If a = c and b ̸= d, then either b < d or d < b. In the first case (a, b) ≺(c, d), and in the second (c, d) ≺(a, b). Hence every pair is comparable, so ≺is total. Therefore, (N2, ≺) is a strict total order. Exercise 20.1.3.

Introduction Informally, the cardinality of a set S, denoted |S|, is the number of elements in the set. For finite sets, this definition is straightforward. However, for infinite sets, it is not immediately clear how we can define the notion of two infinite sets having the same cardinality. Below are some initial questions we might consider: 1 How should we compare the sizes of sets? 2 What does it mean for two sets to have the same size? 3 Should all infinite sets be considered the same size? To motivate our exploration of Questions 1 and 2 , let’s begin with a simpler case. Simpler Question: How can we determine whether two finite sets have the same size? One possible answer is to count the elements in each set. However, this approach breaks down when the sets are infinite. A more flexible method is to pair the elements of the two sets. If we can match each element of set A with exactly one element of set B, with no elements left unmatched in either set, then the two sets must contain the same number of elements. Example 21.1.1. Let A = {w, x, y, z} and B = {♡, ♢, ♣, ♠}. w ↔ ♡ x ↔ ♢ y ↔ ♣ z ↔ ♠ What we are actually doing here is defining a bijection f : A →B. This idea extends naturally to sets of any size and leads to our formal definition of “having the same cardinality.” 131", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

Thus, the formal definition of finite cardinality agrees perfectly with our usual, intuitive notion of “counting” elements. Corollary 21.2.3. If X is a finite set, then there exists a unique n ∈N such that |X|= n. Proof. Let X be a finite set. Suppose, for contradiction, that there exist distinct m, n ∈ N such that |X|= m and |X|= n.

Basic Cardinality Comparisons There are various cardinalities of infinite sets, some of which may appear different in size but actually have the same cardinality. To illustrate this phenomenon, mathematician David Hilbert proposed the famous thought experiment known as Hilbert’s Hotel. 21.3.1. Hilbert’s Hotel Imagine a hotel with infinitely many rooms, enumerated by the natural numbers: 136\n\n Suppose all the rooms at Hilbert’s Hotel are currently occupied. Let’s explore how the hotel can still accommodate additional guests under various scenarios. 1. Suppose 1 new guest arrives. Can we find them a room? Even though all rooms are occupied, we can still accommodate the new guest. Instruct each current guest in room n to move to room n + 1. This frees up room 0, which can now be given to the new guest. This scenario demonstrates that |N ∪{−1}|= |N|. 2. Suppose an infinite number of new guests arrive, enumerated by N. Can we find rooms for them? Despite all rooms being occupied and an infinite number of new guests arriving, it is still possible to find rooms for everyone. Move each current guest in room n to room 2n. This leaves all odd-numbered rooms vacant, which can be assigned to the new guests. Specifically, place new guest m in room 2m + 1. This scenario illustrates that |{0, 1} × N|= |N|. 3. Suppose an infinite number of buses (enumerated by N), each containing an infinite number of guests (also enumerated by N), arrive. Can we find rooms for them? This situation is more challenging, since we now have infinitely many groups of infinitely many guests arriving while all rooms are still occupied. Surprisingly, we can still accommodate everyone by utilizing the fact that there are infinitely many prime numbers, and that for distinct primes p and q and integers k and ℓ, pk ̸= qℓ. Here’s how we proceed: 137\n\n • Move the current guest in room n to room 2n+1. Now, only rooms of the form 2k (for some k ∈Z+) are occupied, leaving all other rooms vacant. • For bus 0, assign new guest n to room 3n+1. • For bus 1, assign new guest n to room 5n+1. • In general, for bus m, assign new guest n to room pn+1 m+2, where pm+2 denotes the (m + 2)-nd prime number. • At this point, every guest has a room, and some rooms remain empty (e.g., rooms 1 and 6). Any room not of the form pk for some prime p and positive integer k is vacant. This scenario shows that |N2|≤|N|, since the room assignment defines an injection rather than a bijection. Recall: We previously constructed a bijection f : N2 →N, confirming that |N2|= |N|. 138\n\n 22. October 24 22.1. Basic Cardinality Comparisons 22.1.1. Countable vs. Uncountable Sets The main distinction among infinite sets that we will discuss is whether they can be placed in bijective correspondence with N. Definitions. A set X is called: • countably infinite if there exists a bijection f : N →X. In this case, we denote its cardinality by |X|= ℵ0. • countable (also called listable or denumerable) if X is either finite or countably infinite. • uncountable if X is infinite but not countably infinite. Up to this point, every set we have encountered is countable. To justify the existence of uncountable sets, we first need to understand why ℵ0 represents the “smallest” infinite cardinality. To do this, we must establish two facts: 1. N is not finite, and 2. if X is an infinite set, then there exists an injection f : N →X. We begin by showing that N is infinite. Specifically, we will prove that there is no bijection f : [n] →N for any n ∈N. The key ingredient is the following lemma. Lemma 22.1.1. If A ⊆N is finite and non-empty, then A has a maximum element. Proof. We proceed by induction on n = |A|. • Base Case: n = 1. Let A = {a1} for some a1 ∈N. Then a1 = max(A). • Inductive Step: Let n ∈Z+ and assume any non-empty finite subset of N with cardinality n has a maximum element. Let A ⊆N with |A|= n+1, and enumerate 139\n\n A as: A = {a1, a2, . . . , an, an+1}. Consider B = A ∖{an+1}. Then |B|= n, so by the inductive hypothesis, B has a maximum element. Let ak = max(B) for some k ∈[n]. We consider two cases: ▶Case 1: ak < an+1. Then for all i ∈[n + 1], ai ≤an+1, so an+1 = max(A). ▶Case 2: ak > an+1. Then ak ≥ai for all i ∈[n + 1], so ak = max(A). In either case, A has a maximum element. By the principle of mathematical induction, the lemma follows. Theorem 22.1.2. The set N is infinite. Proof. Assume, for contradiction, that N is finite. Since N ̸= ∅, there exists n ∈Z+ and a bijection f : [n] →N. Then we may write N = {f(1), f(2), . . . , f(n)}. By Lemma 22.1.1, N has a maximum element, say f(k). However, f(k) + 1 ∈N, contradicting that f(k) is maximal. Hence N is infinite. We have already shown that infinite sets exist, with N serving as one example. To establish that N is the “smallest” infinite set, we will show that it can be injected into any infinite set. Theorem 22.1.3. For any set A, either A is finite or there exists an injection f : N →A. Note. This proof relies on the Axiom of Countable Choice (ACC), which permits making an infinite sequence of choices. We present a simplified overview below. Proof. Let A be a set. If A is finite, there is nothing to prove. Otherwise, assume A is infinite. We will construct an injection f : N →A inductively. For each n ∈N, define Nn = {0, 1, . . . , n}. Choose an arbitrary element a0 ∈A and set f(0) = a0. Now let n ∈N and assume distinct elements f(k) ∈A have been chosen for all k ≤n. Since A is infinite, the set A ∖{f(k) | k ∈Nn} is nonempty. By the ACC, select an element an+1 ∈A ∖{f(k) | k ∈Nn} and define f(n + 1) = an+1. Proceeding in this manner defines a function f : N →A. By construction, f(n + 1) /∈ {f(k) | k ∈Nn}, so f(m) ̸= f(n) whenever m ̸= n. Hence, f is injective. 140\n\n This theorem supports the claim that ℵ0 is the smallest infinite cardinality, since every infinite set has at least this cardinality. A few immediate corollaries follow from this theorem. Corollaries 22.1.4. 1. A set A is infinite if and only if there exists a subset B ⊆A such that |B|= ℵ0. 2. Every subset A ⊆N is either finite or has cardinality |A|= ℵ0. 3. If f : A →N is an injection, then A is countable. 22.1.2. Linear Ordering of Cardinalities We can define a linear ordering of cardinalities on the class of all sets based on two important set-theoretic theorems. Definition. Let S and T be sets. We define: 1. |S|≤|T| if and only if there exists an injection f : S →T. 2. |S|≥|T| if and only if there exists a surjection g : S →T. The definition of |S|≤|T| is motivated by the Cantor–Bernstein–Schr¨oder theorem, which we will explore below. Note. If A and B are finite sets and there exist injections f : A →B and g : B →A, then both f and g must be bijections. In particular, if |A|≤|B| and |B|≤|A|, then |A|= |B|. Question: Does this result extend to infinite sets? Answer: Not directly. Example 22.1.5. Consider the sets N and 2N = {x ∈N | ∃y ∈N, x = 2y}. Define functions f : N →2N by f(n) = 4n and g : 2N →N by g(n) = n. Both f and g are injections, but neither is a bijection. Although having injections in both directions does not imply that the injections themselves are bijections, it does imply that some bijection must exist between the two sets. This result is known as the Cantor–Bernstein–Schr¨oder Theorem (CBS Theorem). 141", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

To do this, we must establish two facts: 1. N is not finite, and 2. if X is an infinite set, then there exists an injection f : N →X. We begin by showing that N is infinite. Specifically, we will prove that there is no bijection f : [n] →N for any n ∈N. The key ingredient is the following lemma. Lemma 22.1.1. If A ⊆N is finite and non-empty, then A has a maximum element. Proof. We proceed by induction on n = |A|. • Base Case: n = 1. Let A = {a1} for some a1 ∈N. Then a1 = max(A). • Inductive Step: Let n ∈Z+ and assume any non-empty finite subset of N with cardinality n has a maximum element. Let A ⊆N with |A|= n+1, and enumerate 139\n\n A as: A = {a1, a2, . . . , an, an+1}. Consider B = A ∖{an+1}. Then |B|= n, so by the inductive hypothesis, B has a maximum element. Let ak = max(B) for some k ∈[n]. We consider two cases: ▶Case 1: ak < an+1. Then for all i ∈[n + 1], ai ≤an+1, so an+1 = max(A). ▶Case 2: ak > an+1. Then ak ≥ai for all i ∈[n + 1], so ak = max(A). In either case, A has a maximum element. By the principle of mathematical induction, the lemma follows. Theorem 22.1.2. The set N is infinite. Proof. Assume, for contradiction, that N is finite. Since N ̸= ∅, there exists n ∈Z+ and a bijection f : [n] →N. Then we may write N = {f(1), f(2), . . . , f(n)}. By Lemma 22.1.1, N has a maximum element, say f(k). However, f(k) + 1 ∈N, contradicting that f(k) is maximal. Hence N is infinite. We have already shown that infinite sets exist, with N serving as one example. To establish that N is the “smallest” infinite set, we will show that it can be injected into any infinite set. Theorem 22.1.3. For any set A, either A is finite or there exists an injection f : N →A. Note. This proof relies on the Axiom of Countable Choice (ACC), which permits making an infinite sequence of choices. We present a simplified overview below. Proof. Let A be a set. If A is finite, there is nothing to prove. Otherwise, assume A is infinite. We will construct an injection f : N →A inductively. For each n ∈N, define Nn = {0, 1, . . . , n}. Choose an arbitrary element a0 ∈A and set f(0) = a0. Now let n ∈N and assume distinct elements f(k) ∈A have been chosen for all k ≤n. Since A is infinite, the set A ∖{f(k) | k ∈Nn} is nonempty. By the ACC, select an element an+1 ∈A ∖{f(k) | k ∈Nn} and define f(n + 1) = an+1. Proceeding in this manner defines a function f : N →A. By construction, f(n + 1) /∈ {f(k) | k ∈Nn}, so f(m) ̸= f(n) whenever m ̸= n. Hence, f is injective. 140\n\n This theorem supports the claim that ℵ0 is the smallest infinite cardinality, since every infinite set has at least this cardinality. A few immediate corollaries follow from this theorem. Corollaries 22.1.4. 1. A set A is infinite if and only if there exists a subset B ⊆A such that |B|= ℵ0. 2. Every subset A ⊆N is either finite or has cardinality |A|= ℵ0. 3. If f : A →N is an injection, then A is countable. 22.1.2. Linear Ordering of Cardinalities We can define a linear ordering of cardinalities on the class of all sets based on two important set-theoretic theorems. Definition. Let S and T be sets. We define: 1. |S|≤|T| if and only if there exists an injection f : S →T. 2. |S|≥|T| if and only if there exists a surjection g : S →T. The definition of |S|≤|T| is motivated by the Cantor–Bernstein–Schr¨oder theorem, which we will explore below. Note. If A and B are finite sets and there exist injections f : A →B and g : B →A, then both f and g must be bijections. In particular, if |A|≤|B| and |B|≤|A|, then |A|= |B|. Question: Does this result extend to infinite sets? Answer: Not directly. Example 22.1.5. Consider the sets N and 2N = {x ∈N | ∃y ∈N, x = 2y}. Define functions f : N →2N by f(n) = 4n and g : 2N →N by g(n) = n. Both f and g are injections, but neither is a bijection. Although having injections in both directions does not imply that the injections themselves are bijections, it does imply that some bijection must exist between the two sets. This result is known as the Cantor–Bernstein–Schr¨oder Theorem (CBS Theorem). 141", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}
{"instruction": "State and prove the following theorem.", "input": "Corollary 12.1.8", "output": "**Corollary:** For M ∈Z, if S = {x ∈Z | x ≥M}, then S is well-ordered. We’ll see two main uses for the Well-Ordering Property. WOP as Part of a Larger Proof In number theory and other fields of discrete mathematics, it is common to use the Well-Ordering Property (the existence of a least element satisfying the proposition) as a step in a larger proof. We’ll use it here to finally complete the proof of the Division Algorithm.\n\n**Proof:** Assume that injections f and g exist. If Img(B) = A, then g is a bijection, and we are done. Otherwise, assume Img(B) ⊊A. Define the set S ⊆A as S = (A ∖Img(B)) ∪  [ n∈Z+ Im(g◦f)n(A ∖Img(B))  . Note that A ∖S ⊆Img(B). Let g−1 denote the inverse of g on the domain Img(B). Define the function h : A →B by h(x) = ( f(x) if x ∈S, g−1(x) if x /∈S. We claim that h is the desired bijection. • Injectivity: Suppose h(x) = h(y) for some x, y ∈A. We consider three cases: ▶Case 1: If x, y ∈S, then f(x) = f(y) implies x = y since f is injective. ▶Case 2: If x, y /∈S, then g−1(x) = g−1(y) implies x = y since g−1 is injective. ▶Case 3: Assume without loss of generality that x ∈S and y /∈S. Then f(x) = g−1(y) implies (g ◦f)(x) = y. Since x ∈S, we have x ∈Im(g◦f)k(A∖Img(B)) for some k ∈N, and thus y ∈Im(g◦f)k+1(A ∖Img(B)) ⊆S, contradicting the assumption that y /∈S. Hence, this case cannot occur. 142\n\n Therefore, h is injective. • Surjectivity: Let y ∈B be arbitrary. We consider two cases: ▶Case 1: If g(y) /∈S, let x = g(y). Then h(x) = g−1(x) = y, as required. ▶Case 2: If g(y) ∈S, then there exists some k ∈N such that g(y) = (g ◦f)k(x) for some x ∈A∖Img(B). Since k > 0, we can write g(y) = (g◦f)(z) = g(f(z)) for z = (g ◦f)k−1(x). Thus, y = f(z) and h(z) = f(z) = y. Therefore, h is surjective. Since h is both injective and surjective, we conclude that h : A →B is a bijection, and hence |A|= |B|. The CBS Theorem justifies our definition of |A|≤|B| when there exists an injection f : A →B. To establish |A|= |B|, it is often easier to show that there exist injections f : A →B and g : B →A than to construct an explicit bijection h : A →B. The CBS Theorem guarantees that if |A|≤|B| and |B|≤|A|, then |A|= |B|, providing the antisymmetry needed for a linear ordering. In practice, the CBS Theorem is used to confirm the existence of some bijection h : A →B without requiring the specific bijection constructed in its proof. To illustrate this, let us revisit Example 22.1.5. Example 22.1.7. Recall from Example 22.1.5 that we defined injections f : N →2N by f(x) = 4x and g : 2N →N by g(x) = x. Both f and g are injections, but neither is a bijection. To construct a bijection between N and 2N using the Cantor–Bernstein–Schr¨oder (CBS) Theorem, we begin by finding the complement of the image of g. Since Img(2N) = 2N, it follows that A ∖Img(B) is the set of odd natural numbers. Define S = (A ∖Img(B)) ∪Img◦f(A ∖Img(B)) ∪Img◦f◦g◦f(A ∖Img(B)) ∪· · · = {odd naturals} ∪{4 · odd naturals} ∪{16 · odd naturals} ∪· · · = {4m(2n + 1) | m, n ∈N}. The set S consists of numbers of the form 4m(2n + 1) for all m, n ∈N, capturing every element covered by the iterative application of f and g. Next, we construct the bijection h : N →2N: h(x) = ( 4x if x = 4m(2n + 1) for some m, n ∈N, x otherwise. This mapping sends each element of S to 4x, pairing it with a unique element of 2N, while leaving elements outside of S unchanged. To visualize this mapping, consider its action on the first few natural numbers: 143\n\n x h(x) x h(x) 1 4 7 28 2 2 8 8 3 12 9 36 4 16 10 10 5 20 11 44 6 6 12 48 The table illustrates how h maps elements from N to 2N. You should verify for yourself that this mapping is indeed injective and surjective, confirming h as a bijection. Note, however, that while the CBS theorem ensures the existence of such a bijection, it does not necessarily yield the simplest one. A much simpler bijection is j : N →2N defined by j(x) = 2x, which is more direct but does not arise from the CBS theorem’s construction. Finally, our definition of ≥is motivated by the following theorem, which tells us that the existence of an injection one way is equivalent to the existence of a surjection the other way. The proof is an elegant application of the Axiom of Choice, which we are assuming throughout. Theorem 22.1.8 (Partition Principle). Let A be a nonempty set and B any set. There exists an injection f : A →B if and only if there exists a surjection g : B →A. Proof sketch. (⇒): Suppose f : A →B is injective. We define a surjection g : B →A as follows: for b ∈Im(f), set g(b) = f−1(b) (well-defined since f is injective). For b /∈Im(f), map b to an arbitrary fixed a0 ∈A. This covers all a ∈A since g(f(a)) = a. (⇐): Suppose f : B →A is surjective. Then for each a ∈A, PreImf({a}) is nonempty. By the Axiom of Choice, there exists a function g : A →B such that g(a) ∈ PreImf({a}) for all a ∈A. (i.e., We select one element from PreImf({a}) for each a ∈A.) This function g is injective: if g(a1) = g(a2), then applying f gives a1 = f(g(a1)) = f(g(a2)) = a2. 144\n\n Exercise 22.1.9. This problem explores the existence of bijections between the open interval (0, 1) and the closed interval [0, 1]. Consider the inclusion map f : (0, 1) →[0, 1] defined by f(x) = x and the function g : [0, 1] →(0, 1) defined by g(x) = 2x+1 4 . (a) Briefly justify that f and g are injections, verifying the hypothesis of the CBS Theorem. (b) The CBS Theorem implies that a bijection h : (0, 1) →[0, 1] exists. Give an explicit formula for the bijection h constructed by the proof of the theorem using these specific functions f and g. (c) Find another bijection j : (0, 1) →[0, 1] (or vice versa) without using the CBS Theorem. Exercise 22.1.10. Let S = {n ∈Z | n ̸≡0 (mod 7)}. Use the CBS Theorem to show that there exists a bijection between S and N. 145\n\n 23. October 27 23.1. Countable Sets Recall that a countably infinite set is a set S that has the same cardinality as N. This represents the smallest size of an infinite set, making it a natural starting point for exploring results about the sizes of infinite sets, which often defy intuition. For instance, we have already shown that there exists a bijection f : N →2N. This implies that |2N|= |N|, even though 2N ⊊N. In other words, there are just as many natural numbers as there are even natural numbers. We have also previously encountered bijections g : N →Z and h : N →N2. Thus, we can conclude that |2N|= |N|= |Z|= |N2|. Next, we will prove some important results about countable sets, beginning with a classic example. We will present two different proofs of this result: the traditional “snaking proof” and an alternative argument using the Cantor–Bernstein–Schr¨oder (CBS) Theorem. 23.1.1. Countability of the Rationals Theorem 23.1.1. The set of rational numbers Q is countably infinite. Proof. We aim to demonstrate the existence of a bijection f : N →Q. In other words, we seek an explicit way to enumerate all rational numbers so that every rational number appears at a finite position in the list. To do so, we arrange all rational numbers of the form a b in a two-dimensional array, where a ∈Z and b ∈Z+. Each entry of this array represents one rational number. We then traverse this array diagonally to ensure that every rational number is encountered within a finite number of steps. Since each diagonal contains only finitely many entries, this process covers the entire array. Beginning at 0, we “snake” our way through the diagonals, skipping any fractions that are not in lowest terms, as illustrated below. 146\n\n This traversal defines a function f : N →Q recursively, assigning to each natural number the corresponding rational number in the sequence. The beginning of this enumeration may be represented as follows: x 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 · · · f(x) 0 1 1 2 −1 2 −1 2 1 3 1 4 −1 3 · · · Every rational number appears exactly once in this list, and each appears at a finite index, establishing a bijection f : N →Q. Hence, Q is countably infinite. We now present an alternative proof that Q is countably infinite, this time using the Cantor–Bernstein–Schr¨oder (CBS) Theorem. For this proof, we assume the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, which we have partially established. Theorem 23.1.2 (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic (FTOA)). Every integer greater than 1 can be written uniquely as a product of prime numbers. We have already shown that every integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of primes. In a later section on number theory, we will prove the uniqueness of this factorization. For the purposes of this proof, we assume the full validity of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Theorem 23.1.3. The set Q is countably infinite. Proof. We will construct injections f : N →Q and g : Q →N. By the CBS Theorem, this will imply |N|= |Q|. 147\n\n • Define f : N →Q by f(n) = n 1 . If f(m) = f(n) for m, n ∈N, then m = n, so f is injective. Hence |N|≤|Q|. • To construct an injection g : Q →N, note that every rational number can be written uniquely in reduced form as a b, where a ∈Z, b ∈Z+, and gcd(a, b) = 1. Define g : Q →N by g \u0010a b \u0011 = ( 2a · 5b if a ≥0, 3−a · 5b if a < 0 where a b ∈Q is in reduced form. We now verify that g is injective. Suppose g(x) = g(y), where x = a1 b1 and y = a2 b2 , with ai ∈Z, bi ∈Z+, and gcd(ai, bi) = 1 for i = 1, 2. We consider three cases: ▶Case 1: a1, a2 ≥0. Then g(x) = g(y) implies 2a15b1 = 2a25b2. By the FTOA, we have a1 = a2 and b1 = b2. ▶Case 2: a1, a2 < 0. Then g(x) = g(y) implies 3−a15b1 = 3−a25b2, and again the FTOA gives a1 = a2 and b1 = b2. ▶Case 3: Without loss of generality, suppose a1 ≥0 and a2 < 0. Then 2a15b1 = 3−a25b2. By the FTOA, this forces a1 = a2 = 0, contradicting a2 < 0. Therefore, g is injective, and |Q|≤|N|. By the Cantor–Bernstein–Schr¨oder Theorem, we conclude that |N|= |Q|, so Q is countably infinite. We have already seen that several familiar sets are countable. We now establish some general results that allow us to construct new countable sets from previously known ones. 23.1.2. Properties of Countable Sets Recall that |N2|= |N|. Using this fact, together with induction, we can prove the following result. Theorem 23.1.4. For any n ∈Z+, |Nn|= ℵ0. Proof. Recall that |N2|= |N|, and let f : N2 →N be a bijection. We proceed by induction on n ∈Z+. • Base Case: For n = 1, we have |N1|= |N|= ℵ0, which holds by definition. 148\n\n • Inductive Step: Suppose that for some n ∈Z+, we have |Nn|= ℵ0. Then there exists a bijection g : Nn →N. Define a function h : Nn+1 →N2 by h((a1, a2, . . . , an), an+1) = (g(a1, a2, . . . , an), an+1). We show that h is a bijection. ▶Injectivity: Suppose h((a1, . . . , an), an+1) = h((b1, . . . , bn), bn+1). Then, by definition of h, (g(a1, . . . , an), an+1) = (g(b1, . . . , bn), bn+1), which implies that g(a1, . . . , an) = g(b1, . . . , bn) and an+1 = bn+1. Since g is injective, it follows that (a1, . . . , an) = (b1, . . . , bn), and hence ai = bi for all i ∈[n + 1]. Thus, h is injective. ▶Surjectivity: Let (x, y) ∈N2 be arbitrary. Since g is surjective, there exists (a1, . . . , an) ∈Nn such that g(a1, . . . , an) = x. Then for ((a1, . . . , an), y) ∈ Nn+1, h((a1, . . . , an), y) = (g(a1, . . . , an), y) = (x, y). Hence h is surjective. Since h is both injective and surjective, it is a bijection. Finally, the composition f ◦h : Nn+1 →N is a bijection, since it is the composition of two bijections. Therefore, |Nn+1|= |N|= ℵ0. By the principle of mathematical induction, we conclude that |Nn|= ℵ0 for all n ∈ Z+. Combining this result with the properties of finite Cartesian products, we obtain the following theorem. Theorem 23.1.5 (Finite Product of Countable Sets is Countable). If n ∈Z+ and X1, . . . , Xn are nonempty countable sets, then n Y i=1 Xi = X1 × X2 × · · · × Xn is countable. Moreover, if at least one Xi is infinite, then Qn i=1 Xi is countably infinite. 149\n\n We’ve seen that we can take finite Cartesian products of countable sets and remain countable. For unions of sets, we can do even better. The following result shows that a countably infinite union of countably infinite sets is still countably infinite. Theorem 23.1.6. Suppose {An}n∈N is a family of countably infinite sets. Then [ n∈N An is countably infinite. Proof. Let A = S n∈N An. We will show that ℵ0 ≤|A| and ℵ0 ≥|A|. • Since A0 is countably infinite, there exists a bijection f0 : N →A0. Define g : N → A by g(n) = f0(n). Because f0 is injective, g is also injective. Hence ℵ0 = |N|≤|A|. • For each n ∈N, let fn : N →An be a bijection (which exists because |An|= ℵ0 by assumption). Define h : N2 →A by h(n, m) = fn(m). We will show that h is surjective. Let a ∈A be arbitrary. Then a ∈An for some n ∈N. Fix such an n. Since fn is surjective, there exists m ∈N such that fn(m) = a. Thus h(n, m) = fn(m) = a. Because a ∈A was arbitrary, h is surjective. Therefore ℵ0 = |N2|≥|A|. By the Cantor–Bernstein–Schr¨oder Theorem and the partition principle, it follows that |A|= ℵ0, as desired. Since a countably infinite union of countably infinite sets is countably infinite, it follows that when we take either fewer unions or smaller sets, the union remains countable. Corollaries 23.1.7 (A Countable Union of Countable Sets is Countable). 1. If |A|= ℵ0 and |B|≤ℵ0, then |A ∪B|= ℵ0. 2. If {Ai}i∈N is a family of countable sets, then A = S i∈N Ai is countable. 3. If {Ai}i∈[n] (for some n ∈Z+) is a finite family of countable sets, then A = S i∈[n] Ai is countable. Moreover: a) If |Ai|= ℵ0 for at least one i ∈[n], then |A|= ℵ0. b) If each Ai is finite, then A is finite with |A|≥max{|Ai|}i∈[n]. Note. Regarding part (3b) in the previous corollary, we will discuss a formula for determining |A| in the combinatorics section later in the semester. 150\n\n Exercise 23.1.8. Show that the following sets are countably infinite. (a) A = {f : {0, 1} →N | f is a function} (b) B = the set of circles in R2 whose centers have integer coordinates and whose radii have rational lengths. (c) C = {f : N →N | ∀x ∈N, f(x + 1) = f(x) + 1} (d) D = the set of all “words”, where a “word” is a finite string of letters from the English alphabet. 23.2. Uncountable Sets So far, we have shown that many different infinite sets share the same size as N. This might naturally lead to the question: do uncountably infinite sets even exist? In this section, we will not only demonstrate that uncountably infinite sets do exist, but also establish that there are multiple distinct sizes (cardinalities) among uncountably infinite sets. Our main proof technique will be a powerful method known as diagonalization. 23.2.1. Uncountability of the Real Numbers To show that the real numbers are uncountable, we need to establish that there is no possible way to enumerate them. How can we prove that such an enumeration cannot exist? As is often done in mathematics, we will proceed by contradiction. To make this argument concrete, we will describe real numbers using their decimal expansions and apply a diagonalization argument. A real number x ∈R can be represented in its decimal form as x = x0.x1x2x3 · · · , where x0 ∈Z is the integer part, and xi ∈N with 0 ≤xi ≤9 for i ∈Z+ represent the decimal digits. For example, 5 6 = 0.83333 · · · = 0.83. Technical Note: Decimal representations are not always unique. In particular, a decimal that ends with an infinite sequence of 9’s is equal to the corresponding decimal that ends with an infinite sequence of 0’s. (This is usually proved in Calculus 2 using geometric series.) For example, 0.499999 · · · = 0.50000 · · · . To avoid this ambiguity, we adopt the following convention: a decimal representation of x ∈R is said to be in normalized form if it does not end with an infinite string of 9’s. 151\n\n Exercise 23.2.1. (For those who have taken Calculus 2) Suppose that x ∈[0, 1) has two distinct decimal expansions: x = 0.a1a2a3 · · · , x = 0.b1b2b3 · · · , where ai, bi ∈{0, 1, . . . , 9} for all i. Let M be the smallest positive integer such that aM ̸= bM and assume that aM > bM. Prove that: • ai = bi for all 1 ≤i < M, • aM = bM + 1, • ai = 0 and bi = 9 for all i > M. With this convention in place, we can now use diagonalization to prove that there are uncountably many real numbers in the interval (0, 1). 152\n\n 24. October 29 24.1. Uncountable Sets 24.1.1. Uncountability of the Real Numbers Theorem 24.1.1. The open interval (0, 1) is uncountable. Proof. Let f : Z+ →(0, 1) be an arbitrary function. We aim to show that f is not surjective. For each n ∈Z+, write f(n) in normalized decimal form as f(1) = 0.c1,1c1,2c1,3 · · · f(2) = 0.c2,1c2,2c2,3 · · · f(3) = 0.c3,1c3,2c3,3 · · · f(4) = 0.c4,1c4,2c4,3 · · · ... ... We will construct a number x ∈(0, 1) such that x /∈Im(f). Define x by specifying its nth digit xn as xn = ( 1, if cn,n ̸= 1, 2, if cn,n = 1. By construction, xn ̸= cn,n for all n ∈Z+. Thus x differs from f(n) in the nth decimal place for every n, meaning x ̸= f(n) for all n ∈Z+. Since x ∈(0, 1) and x /∈Im(f), it follows that f is not surjective. Because f : Z+ →(0, 1) was chosen arbitrarily, this shows that ℵ0 = |Z+|< |(0, 1)|. Therefore, the interval (0, 1) is uncountable. Note. The proof above illustrates the general idea behind diagonalization: given any attempt to list all elements of a certain set (for example, f(1), f(2), f(3), . . . ), we construct a new element that systematically differs from each listed one in at least one place. More precisely, the diagonalization strategy involves the following pattern: 1. Assume, for contradiction, that an enumeration of the set exists. 153\n\n 2. Represent each element in a way that exposes infinitely many “coordinates” or distinguishable components (for example, digits of a real number, or values of a sequence). 3. Construct a new element by changing the nth coordinate (or component) of the nth listed element in a deliberate way. 4. Conclude that this new element differs from every element in the list, contradicting the assumption of a complete enumeration. The key feature of diagonalization is that the new element disagrees with the nth listed element in the nth component, ensuring that it is distinct from every item in the list. This strategy generalizes beyond decimal expansions. In each case, the heart of the argument is the same: no enumeration can capture every possible object once we can systematically construct one that escapes the list. Corollary 24.1.2. R is uncountable, and |R|= |(0, 1)|. Proof. Define f : (0, 1) →R by f(x) = ln \u00121 −x x \u0013 . Proving that f is a bijection was left as an exercise earlier. Since (0, 1) is uncountable and f is a bijection, it follows that R is also uncountable. Corollary 24.1.3. For any a, b ∈R with a < b, each of the following sets is uncountable: • (a, b) • (a, b] • [a, b) • [a, b] • (−∞, b) • (−∞, b] • (a, ∞) • [a, ∞) 24.1.2. Cantor’s Theorem Our diagonalization argument for the real numbers revealed that (0, 1) cannot be enumerated by the natural numbers. Cantor’s Theorem extends this idea even further: for any set S, the collection of all its subsets—its power set—is strictly larger than S itself. Theorem 24.1.4 (Cantor’s Theorem). For any set S, we have |S|< |P(S)|. 154\n\n Notes. • If S is finite, Cantor’s Theorem can be verified directly. In Homework 7, we proved that |P([n])|= 2n for all n ∈N, and it can be proven by induction that n < 2n for all n ∈N. • For infinite sets S, the theorem implies an infinite hierarchy of distinct infinite cardinalities, obtained by repeatedly taking power sets. For example: |N|< |P(N)|< |P(P(N))|< |P(P(P(N)))|< · · · Proof. Let S be an arbitrary set, and suppose g : S →P(S) is any function. Define a set T ∈P(S) by T = {x ∈S | x /∈g(x)}. We will show that T ̸= g(x) for any x ∈S. Let x ∈S be arbitrary. ▶Case 1: Suppose x ∈T. Then, by definition of T, we have x /∈g(x). Hence x ∈T but x /∈g(x), so T ̸= g(x). ▶Case 2: Suppose x /∈T. Then, by definition of T, we have x ∈g(x). Hence x /∈T but x ∈g(x), so again T ̸= g(x). Thus T ̸= g(x) for every x ∈S, meaning T is not in the image of g. Therefore g is not surjective. Since g : S →P(S) was arbitrary, no surjection from S onto P(S) exists, and hence |S|< |P(S)|. The construction in the proof is another example of diagonalization, where we created a new set T that disagrees with each g(x) regarding the membership of x. Example 24.1.5. To illustrate Cantor’s Theorem for the case S = N, we will show that no surjection f : N →P(N) can exist. Let f : N →P(N) be an arbitrary function, and define T = {n ∈N | n /∈f(n)}. We claim that T is not equal to f(n) for any n ∈N. To get some intuition, let us look at a few examples. • Suppose f(0) = {0, 3}. Then 0 /∈T because 0 ∈f(0), so T ̸= f(0). • Suppose f(1) = {5}. Then 1 ∈T because 1 /∈f(1), so T ̸= f(1). • Suppose f(2) = N. Then 2 /∈T because 2 ∈f(2), so T ̸= f(2). • Suppose f(3) = {1, 2, 4}. Then 3 ∈T because 3 /∈f(3), so T ̸= f(3). In each case, T differs from f(n) at the element n itself. More generally, for any n ∈N, we have two cases: 155\n\n ▶Case 1: If n ∈f(n), then n /∈T, so T ̸= f(n). ▶Case 2: If n /∈f(n), then n ∈T, so T ̸= f(n). Thus, for every n ∈N, the set T differs from f(n) in at least one element—specifically, at the “diagonal position” n. This pattern of constructing a new object that disagrees with the n-th object at the n-th coordinate is the essence of the diagonalization method. Since T ∈P(N) and T ̸= f(n) for all n ∈N, we conclude that f is not a surjection. Therefore, |N|< |P(N)|. Diagonalization thus provides a systematic way to construct an element not listed in any proposed enumeration. 24.1.3. Infinite Binary Sequences The technique used in Cantor’s Theorem also applies to other sets with infinite structure. One important example is the set of all infinite binary sequences. Although this result was proven in recitation, we restate it here to highlight its connection with Cantor’s argument. Theorem 24.1.6. Define {0, 1}N as the set of all infinite sequences consisting of 0s and 1s. That is, {0, 1}N = {⟨ai⟩i∈N | ∀i ∈N, ai ∈{0, 1}} . Then {0, 1}N is uncountably infinite. Cantor’s diagonal argument can be adapted to this setting by assuming we have an enumeration of all infinite binary sequences and then constructing a new sequence that differs from the n-th sequence at its n-th position. The resulting sequence cannot appear in the list, proving that no enumeration can include every element of {0, 1}N. Conceptually, this result is equivalent to Cantor’s Theorem for P(N): each infinite binary sequence can be viewed as the characteristic function of a subset of N. Thus, {0, 1}N and P(N) have the same cardinality, providing another example of how diagonalization exposes uncountable structures. Exercise 24.1.7. Show that the following sets are uncountable. (a) A = {f : N →{0, 1} | f is a function} (b) B = {f : N →N | f is a function} (c) C = {f : N →N | f is a bijection} 156\n\n (d) D = the set of infinite sequences of integers. (e) E = R ∖Q[ √ 2] where Q[ √ 2] = {x ∈R | ∃a, b ∈Q, x = a + b √ 2} 157\n\n Part V. Number Theory 158\n\n 25. October 29 25.1. Introduction Number theory is possibly the oldest field of mathematics, and much of modern mathematics has its roots in it. The simplest description of number theory is the study of arithmetic. Number theorists investigate the fundamental properties of the integers, exploring their structure and relationships. At the heart of this field lies the study of prime numbers, which play a central role. Many of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics are found in number theory, often characterized by their simplicity to state but difficulty to solve. Examples of Number Theoretic Results and Conjectures 1. There are infinitely many ordered triples of positive integers (x, y, z) such that x2 + y2 = z2. 2. Fermat’s Last Theorem: There are no ordered triples of positive integers (x, y, z) such that xn + yn = zn for any n ≥3. 3. Lagrange’s Four-Square Theorem: Every nonnegative integer can be expressed as the sum of four perfect squares. For example, 35 = 52 + 32 + 12 + 02. 4. Goldbach’s Conjecture: Every even integer greater than 2 can be written as the sum of two prime numbers. For example, 14 = 3 + 11 (or 14 = 7 + 7). 5. Twin Prime Conjecture: There are infinitely many pairs of prime numbers of the form (p, p + 2). To begin our study of number theory, we will first review some relevant definitions and results from earlier sections. • A natural number n > 1 is called prime if its only divisors are 1 and itself. In other words, if n is prime and n = ab for a, b ∈N, then either a = 1 or b = 1 (Lecture 11). • A natural number n > 1 is called composite if there exist a, b ∈N such that 1 < a ≤b < n and n = ab. In other words, n > 1 and is not prime. • The natural number n = 1 is called a unit. 159\n\n • Every natural number n > 1 is either prime or can be expressed as a product of prime numbers (Theorem 11.1.7). We now state a useful result that was proved in class on September 8, and repeat the proof here for reference: Theorem 25.1.1. Let m, n ∈Z be nonzero integers. If m | n, then |m|≤|n|. Proof. Let m, n ∈Z ∖{0} such that m | n. Then there exists an integer a ∈Z such that n = ma. Since the absolute value function is multiplicative, we have |n|= |m|·|a|. Because m and n are nonzero, a ̸= 0, which implies |a|≥1. Therefore, |n|= |m|·|a|≥ |m|·1 = |m|. The following corollary is an immediate consequence of the theorem. Corollary 25.1.2. Let m, n ∈Z. If m | n and n | m, then m = ±n. From the definitions and results above, we know that every composite integer n has a prime factor p < n. In fact, we can say more: every composite integer n has a prime factor p ≤√n. This observation provides a straightforward (though inefficient) method for checking whether a natural number n is prime. Theorem 25.1.3. If n ∈N is composite, then n has a prime factor p such that p ≤√n. Proof. Let n ∈N be composite, and express n as n = ab for some a, b ∈N with 1 < a ≤b < n. We first show that a ≤√n. Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that a > √n. Then n = (√n)2 < a2 ≤ab = n, which yields the contradiction n < n. Therefore, a ≤√n. Let p be any prime divisor of a (possibly a itself, if a is prime). Then p ≤a ≤√n and, since p | a and a | n, it follows by transitivity that p | n. Example 25.1.4. Use the previous theorem to determine whether 91 or 97 is prime. Observe that √ 91 < √ 97 < 10, and the only prime numbers less than 10 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. To determine whether 91 or 97 is prime, we need to check if they are divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7. 160\n\n • It is clear that 2 ∤91 (since 91 is odd) and 5 ∤91 (since 91 does not end in 0 or 5). We also find that 3 ∤91, but we notice that 7 | 91 and 91 = 7 · 13. Thus, 91 is composite . • Similarly, 2 ∤97 and 5 ∤97. Checking for divisibility by 3 and 7, we find that 3 ∤97 and 7 ∤97. Therefore, 97 is prime . Exercise 25.1.5. Determine which of the following integers are primes. (a) 201 (b) 203 (c) 207 (d) 211 (e) 213 (f) 221 161\n\n 26. October 31 26.1. GCDs, LCMs, and Linear Combinations By Theorem 25.1.1, if n is a nonzero integer, then n can have only finitely many divisors, since m | n implies |m|≤|n|. Because any two nonzero integers each have finitely many divisors, it is natural to define the greatest divisor common to both. In fact, we can relax this requirement so that only one of the integers must be nonzero. Definition. For a, b ∈Z, not both zero, an integer d is called a common divisor of a and b if d | a and d | b. Furthermore, d is called the greatest common divisor of a and b, denoted gcd(a, b), if d is the largest of their common divisors. Examples 26.1.1. 1. Consider m = 54 and n = 42. Set of divisors of 54 = {±1, ±2, ±3, ±6, ±9, ±18, ±27, ±54}, Set of divisors of 42 = {±1, ±2, ±3, ±6, ±7, ±14, ±21, ±42}, Set of common divisors = {±1, ±2, ±3, ±6}. Therefore, gcd(54, 42) = 6, the largest element from the set of common divisors. 2. gcd(−6, −15) = 3. Even though both integers are negative, the greatest common divisor is always taken to be positive. 3. gcd(0, 44) = 44. Since every integer divides 0, we have gcd(0, n) = |n| for any integer n ̸= 0. (The value gcd(0, 0) is undefined.) Since the divisors of −m are the same as those of m, it follows that gcd(m, n) = gcd(|m|, |n|). Therefore, we often restrict our attention to pairs of nonnegative integers. Definition. Let a, b ∈Z, not both zero. Then a and b are called relatively prime (or coprime) if gcd(a, b) = 1. The following theorem states that if we divide a and b by their greatest common divisor, then the resulting integers have no common divisors other than ±1. This simple but powerful result is foundational in the study of arithmetic. 162", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

Otherwise, assume Img(B) ⊊A. Define the set S ⊆A as S = (A ∖Img(B)) ∪  [ n∈Z+ Im(g◦f)n(A ∖Img(B))  . Note that A ∖S ⊆Img(B). Let g−1 denote the inverse of g on the domain Img(B). Define the function h : A →B by h(x) = ( f(x) if x ∈S, g−1(x) if x /∈S. We claim that h is the desired bijection. • Injectivity: Suppose h(x) = h(y) for some x, y ∈A. We consider three cases: ▶Case 1: If x, y ∈S, then f(x) = f(y) implies x = y since f is injective. ▶Case 2: If x, y /∈S, then g−1(x) = g−1(y) implies x = y since g−1 is injective. ▶Case 3: Assume without loss of generality that x ∈S and y /∈S. Then f(x) = g−1(y) implies (g ◦f)(x) = y. Since x ∈S, we have x ∈Im(g◦f)k(A∖Img(B)) for some k ∈N, and thus y ∈Im(g◦f)k+1(A ∖Img(B)) ⊆S, contradicting the assumption that y /∈S. Hence, this case cannot occur. 142\n\n Therefore, h is injective. • Surjectivity: Let y ∈B be arbitrary. We consider two cases: ▶Case 1: If g(y) /∈S, let x = g(y). Then h(x) = g−1(x) = y, as required. ▶Case 2: If g(y) ∈S, then there exists some k ∈N such that g(y) = (g ◦f)k(x) for some x ∈A∖Img(B). Since k > 0, we can write g(y) = (g◦f)(z) = g(f(z)) for z = (g ◦f)k−1(x). Thus, y = f(z) and h(z) = f(z) = y. Therefore, h is surjective. Since h is both injective and surjective, we conclude that h : A →B is a bijection, and hence |A|= |B|. The CBS Theorem justifies our definition of |A|≤|B| when there exists an injection f : A →B. To establish |A|= |B|, it is often easier to show that there exist injections f : A →B and g : B →A than to construct an explicit bijection h : A →B. The CBS Theorem guarantees that if |A|≤|B| and |B|≤|A|, then |A|= |B|, providing the antisymmetry needed for a linear ordering. In practice, the CBS Theorem is used to confirm the existence of some bijection h : A →B without requiring the specific bijection constructed in its proof. To illustrate this, let us revisit Example 22.1.5. Example 22.1.7. Recall from Example 22.1.5 that we defined injections f : N →2N by f(x) = 4x and g : 2N →N by g(x) = x. Both f and g are injections, but neither is a bijection. To construct a bijection between N and 2N using the Cantor–Bernstein–Schr¨oder (CBS) Theorem, we begin by finding the complement of the image of g. Since Img(2N) = 2N, it follows that A ∖Img(B) is the set of odd natural numbers. Define S = (A ∖Img(B)) ∪Img◦f(A ∖Img(B)) ∪Img◦f◦g◦f(A ∖Img(B)) ∪· · · = {odd naturals} ∪{4 · odd naturals} ∪{16 · odd naturals} ∪· · · = {4m(2n + 1) | m, n ∈N}. The set S consists of numbers of the form 4m(2n + 1) for all m, n ∈N, capturing every element covered by the iterative application of f and g. Next, we construct the bijection h : N →2N: h(x) = ( 4x if x = 4m(2n + 1) for some m, n ∈N, x otherwise. This mapping sends each element of S to 4x, pairing it with a unique element of 2N, while leaving elements outside of S unchanged. To visualize this mapping, consider its action on the first few natural numbers: 143\n\n x h(x) x h(x) 1 4 7 28 2 2 8 8 3 12 9 36 4 16 10 10 5 20 11 44 6 6 12 48 The table illustrates how h maps elements from N to 2N. You should verify for yourself that this mapping is indeed injective and surjective, confirming h as a bijection. Note, however, that while the CBS theorem ensures the existence of such a bijection, it does not necessarily yield the simplest one. A much simpler bijection is j : N →2N defined by j(x) = 2x, which is more direct but does not arise from the CBS theorem’s construction. Finally, our definition of ≥is motivated by the following theorem, which tells us that the existence of an injection one way is equivalent to the existence of a surjection the other way. The proof is an elegant application of the Axiom of Choice, which we are assuming throughout. Theorem 22.1.8 (Partition Principle). Let A be a nonempty set and B any set. There exists an injection f : A →B if and only if there exists a surjection g : B →A. Proof sketch. (⇒): Suppose f : A →B is injective. We define a surjection g : B →A as follows: for b ∈Im(f), set g(b) = f−1(b) (well-defined since f is injective). For b /∈Im(f), map b to an arbitrary fixed a0 ∈A. This covers all a ∈A since g(f(a)) = a. (⇐): Suppose f : B →A is surjective. Then for each a ∈A, PreImf({a}) is nonempty. By the Axiom of Choice, there exists a function g : A →B such that g(a) ∈ PreImf({a}) for all a ∈A. (i.e., We select one element from PreImf({a}) for each a ∈A.) This function g is injective: if g(a1) = g(a2), then applying f gives a1 = f(g(a1)) = f(g(a2)) = a2. 144\n\n Exercise 22.1.9. This problem explores the existence of bijections between the open interval (0, 1) and the closed interval [0, 1]. Consider the inclusion map f : (0, 1) →[0, 1] defined by f(x) = x and the function g : [0, 1] →(0, 1) defined by g(x) = 2x+1 4 . (a) Briefly justify that f and g are injections, verifying the hypothesis of the CBS Theorem. (b) The CBS Theorem implies that a bijection h : (0, 1) →[0, 1] exists. Give an explicit formula for the bijection h constructed by the proof of the theorem using these specific functions f and g. (c) Find another bijection j : (0, 1) →[0, 1] (or vice versa) without using the CBS Theorem. Exercise 22.1.10. Let S = {n ∈Z | n ̸≡0 (mod 7)}. Use the CBS Theorem to show that there exists a bijection between S and N. 145\n\n 23. October 27 23.1. Countable Sets Recall that a countably infinite set is a set S that has the same cardinality as N. This represents the smallest size of an infinite set, making it a natural starting point for exploring results about the sizes of infinite sets, which often defy intuition. For instance, we have already shown that there exists a bijection f : N →2N. This implies that |2N|= |N|, even though 2N ⊊N. In other words, there are just as many natural numbers as there are even natural numbers. We have also previously encountered bijections g : N →Z and h : N →N2. Thus, we can conclude that |2N|= |N|= |Z|= |N2|. Next, we will prove some important results about countable sets, beginning with a classic example. We will present two different proofs of this result: the traditional “snaking proof” and an alternative argument using the Cantor–Bernstein–Schr¨oder (CBS) Theorem. 23.1.1. Countability of the Rationals Theorem 23.1.1. The set of rational numbers Q is countably infinite. Proof. We aim to demonstrate the existence of a bijection f : N →Q. In other words, we seek an explicit way to enumerate all rational numbers so that every rational number appears at a finite position in the list. To do so, we arrange all rational numbers of the form a b in a two-dimensional array, where a ∈Z and b ∈Z+. Each entry of this array represents one rational number. We then traverse this array diagonally to ensure that every rational number is encountered within a finite number of steps. Since each diagonal contains only finitely many entries, this process covers the entire array. Beginning at 0, we “snake” our way through the diagonals, skipping any fractions that are not in lowest terms, as illustrated below. 146\n\n This traversal defines a function f : N →Q recursively, assigning to each natural number the corresponding rational number in the sequence. The beginning of this enumeration may be represented as follows: x 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 · · · f(x) 0 1 1 2 −1 2 −1 2 1 3 1 4 −1 3 · · · Every rational number appears exactly once in this list, and each appears at a finite index, establishing a bijection f : N →Q. Hence, Q is countably infinite. We now present an alternative proof that Q is countably infinite, this time using the Cantor–Bernstein–Schr¨oder (CBS) Theorem. For this proof, we assume the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, which we have partially established. Theorem 23.1.2 (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic (FTOA)). Every integer greater than 1 can be written uniquely as a product of prime numbers. We have already shown that every integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of primes. In a later section on number theory, we will prove the uniqueness of this factorization. For the purposes of this proof, we assume the full validity of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Theorem 23.1.3. The set Q is countably infinite. Proof. We will construct injections f : N →Q and g : Q →N. By the CBS Theorem, this will imply |N|= |Q|. 147\n\n • Define f : N →Q by f(n) = n 1 . If f(m) = f(n) for m, n ∈N, then m = n, so f is injective. Hence |N|≤|Q|. • To construct an injection g : Q →N, note that every rational number can be written uniquely in reduced form as a b, where a ∈Z, b ∈Z+, and gcd(a, b) = 1. Define g : Q →N by g \u0010a b \u0011 = ( 2a · 5b if a ≥0, 3−a · 5b if a < 0 where a b ∈Q is in reduced form. We now verify that g is injective. Suppose g(x) = g(y), where x = a1 b1 and y = a2 b2 , with ai ∈Z, bi ∈Z+, and gcd(ai, bi) = 1 for i = 1, 2. We consider three cases: ▶Case 1: a1, a2 ≥0. Then g(x) = g(y) implies 2a15b1 = 2a25b2. By the FTOA, we have a1 = a2 and b1 = b2. ▶Case 2: a1, a2 < 0. Then g(x) = g(y) implies 3−a15b1 = 3−a25b2, and again the FTOA gives a1 = a2 and b1 = b2. ▶Case 3: Without loss of generality, suppose a1 ≥0 and a2 < 0. Then 2a15b1 = 3−a25b2. By the FTOA, this forces a1 = a2 = 0, contradicting a2 < 0. Therefore, g is injective, and |Q|≤|N|. By the Cantor–Bernstein–Schr¨oder Theorem, we conclude that |N|= |Q|, so Q is countably infinite. We have already seen that several familiar sets are countable. We now establish some general results that allow us to construct new countable sets from previously known ones. 23.1.2. Properties of Countable Sets Recall that |N2|= |N|. Using this fact, together with induction, we can prove the following result. Theorem 23.1.4. For any n ∈Z+, |Nn|= ℵ0. Proof. Recall that |N2|= |N|, and let f : N2 →N be a bijection. We proceed by induction on n ∈Z+. • Base Case: For n = 1, we have |N1|= |N|= ℵ0, which holds by definition. 148\n\n • Inductive Step: Suppose that for some n ∈Z+, we have |Nn|= ℵ0. Then there exists a bijection g : Nn →N. Define a function h : Nn+1 →N2 by h((a1, a2, . . . , an), an+1) = (g(a1, a2, . . . , an), an+1). We show that h is a bijection. ▶Injectivity: Suppose h((a1, . . . , an), an+1) = h((b1, . . . , bn), bn+1). Then, by definition of h, (g(a1, . . . , an), an+1) = (g(b1, . . . , bn), bn+1), which implies that g(a1, . . . , an) = g(b1, . . . , bn) and an+1 = bn+1. Since g is injective, it follows that (a1, . . . , an) = (b1, . . . , bn), and hence ai = bi for all i ∈[n + 1]. Thus, h is injective. ▶Surjectivity: Let (x, y) ∈N2 be arbitrary. Since g is surjective, there exists (a1, . . . , an) ∈Nn such that g(a1, . . . , an) = x. Then for ((a1, . . . , an), y) ∈ Nn+1, h((a1, . . . , an), y) = (g(a1, . . . , an), y) = (x, y). Hence h is surjective. Since h is both injective and surjective, it is a bijection. Finally, the composition f ◦h : Nn+1 →N is a bijection, since it is the composition of two bijections. Therefore, |Nn+1|= |N|= ℵ0. By the principle of mathematical induction, we conclude that |Nn|= ℵ0 for all n ∈ Z+. Combining this result with the properties of finite Cartesian products, we obtain the following theorem. Theorem 23.1.5 (Finite Product of Countable Sets is Countable). If n ∈Z+ and X1, . . . , Xn are nonempty countable sets, then n Y i=1 Xi = X1 × X2 × · · · × Xn is countable. Moreover, if at least one Xi is infinite, then Qn i=1 Xi is countably infinite. 149\n\n We’ve seen that we can take finite Cartesian products of countable sets and remain countable. For unions of sets, we can do even better. The following result shows that a countably infinite union of countably infinite sets is still countably infinite. Theorem 23.1.6. Suppose {An}n∈N is a family of countably infinite sets. Then [ n∈N An is countably infinite. Proof. Let A = S n∈N An. We will show that ℵ0 ≤|A| and ℵ0 ≥|A|. • Since A0 is countably infinite, there exists a bijection f0 : N →A0. Define g : N → A by g(n) = f0(n). Because f0 is injective, g is also injective. Hence ℵ0 = |N|≤|A|. • For each n ∈N, let fn : N →An be a bijection (which exists because |An|= ℵ0 by assumption). Define h : N2 →A by h(n, m) = fn(m). We will show that h is surjective. Let a ∈A be arbitrary. Then a ∈An for some n ∈N. Fix such an n. Since fn is surjective, there exists m ∈N such that fn(m) = a. Thus h(n, m) = fn(m) = a. Because a ∈A was arbitrary, h is surjective. Therefore ℵ0 = |N2|≥|A|. By the Cantor–Bernstein–Schr¨oder Theorem and the partition principle, it follows that |A|= ℵ0, as desired. Since a countably infinite union of countably infinite sets is countably infinite, it follows that when we take either fewer unions or smaller sets, the union remains countable. Corollaries 23.1.7 (A Countable Union of Countable Sets is Countable). 1. If |A|= ℵ0 and |B|≤ℵ0, then |A ∪B|= ℵ0. 2. If {Ai}i∈N is a family of countable sets, then A = S i∈N Ai is countable. 3. If {Ai}i∈[n] (for some n ∈Z+) is a finite family of countable sets, then A = S i∈[n] Ai is countable. Moreover: a) If |Ai|= ℵ0 for at least one i ∈[n], then |A|= ℵ0. b) If each Ai is finite, then A is finite with |A|≥max{|Ai|}i∈[n]. Note. Regarding part (3b) in the previous corollary, we will discuss a formula for determining |A| in the combinatorics section later in the semester. 150\n\n Exercise 23.1.8. Show that the following sets are countably infinite. (a) A = {f : {0, 1} →N | f is a function} (b) B = the set of circles in R2 whose centers have integer coordinates and whose radii have rational lengths. (c) C = {f : N →N | ∀x ∈N, f(x + 1) = f(x) + 1} (d) D = the set of all “words”, where a “word” is a finite string of letters from the English alphabet. 23.2. Uncountable Sets So far, we have shown that many different infinite sets share the same size as N. This might naturally lead to the question: do uncountably infinite sets even exist? In this section, we will not only demonstrate that uncountably infinite sets do exist, but also establish that there are multiple distinct sizes (cardinalities) among uncountably infinite sets. Our main proof technique will be a powerful method known as diagonalization. 23.2.1. Uncountability of the Real Numbers To show that the real numbers are uncountable, we need to establish that there is no possible way to enumerate them. How can we prove that such an enumeration cannot exist? As is often done in mathematics, we will proceed by contradiction. To make this argument concrete, we will describe real numbers using their decimal expansions and apply a diagonalization argument. A real number x ∈R can be represented in its decimal form as x = x0.x1x2x3 · · · , where x0 ∈Z is the integer part, and xi ∈N with 0 ≤xi ≤9 for i ∈Z+ represent the decimal digits. For example, 5 6 = 0.83333 · · · = 0.83. Technical Note: Decimal representations are not always unique. In particular, a decimal that ends with an infinite sequence of 9’s is equal to the corresponding decimal that ends with an infinite sequence of 0’s. (This is usually proved in Calculus 2 using geometric series.) For example, 0.499999 · · · = 0.50000 · · · . To avoid this ambiguity, we adopt the following convention: a decimal representation of x ∈R is said to be in normalized form if it does not end with an infinite string of 9’s. 151\n\n Exercise 23.2.1. (For those who have taken Calculus 2) Suppose that x ∈[0, 1) has two distinct decimal expansions: x = 0.a1a2a3 · · · , x = 0.b1b2b3 · · · , where ai, bi ∈{0, 1, . . . , 9} for all i. Let M be the smallest positive integer such that aM ̸= bM and assume that aM > bM. Prove that: • ai = bi for all 1 ≤i < M, • aM = bM + 1, • ai = 0 and bi = 9 for all i > M. With this convention in place, we can now use diagonalization to prove that there are uncountably many real numbers in the interval (0, 1). 152\n\n 24. October 29 24.1. Uncountable Sets 24.1.1. Uncountability of the Real Numbers Theorem 24.1.1. The open interval (0, 1) is uncountable. Proof. Let f : Z+ →(0, 1) be an arbitrary function. We aim to show that f is not surjective. For each n ∈Z+, write f(n) in normalized decimal form as f(1) = 0.c1,1c1,2c1,3 · · · f(2) = 0.c2,1c2,2c2,3 · · · f(3) = 0.c3,1c3,2c3,3 · · · f(4) = 0.c4,1c4,2c4,3 · · · ... ... We will construct a number x ∈(0, 1) such that x /∈Im(f). Define x by specifying its nth digit xn as xn = ( 1, if cn,n ̸= 1, 2, if cn,n = 1. By construction, xn ̸= cn,n for all n ∈Z+. Thus x differs from f(n) in the nth decimal place for every n, meaning x ̸= f(n) for all n ∈Z+. Since x ∈(0, 1) and x /∈Im(f), it follows that f is not surjective. Because f : Z+ →(0, 1) was chosen arbitrarily, this shows that ℵ0 = |Z+|< |(0, 1)|. Therefore, the interval (0, 1) is uncountable. Note. The proof above illustrates the general idea behind diagonalization: given any attempt to list all elements of a certain set (for example, f(1), f(2), f(3), . . . ), we construct a new element that systematically differs from each listed one in at least one place. More precisely, the diagonalization strategy involves the following pattern: 1. Assume, for contradiction, that an enumeration of the set exists. 153\n\n 2. Represent each element in a way that exposes infinitely many “coordinates” or distinguishable components (for example, digits of a real number, or values of a sequence). 3. Construct a new element by changing the nth coordinate (or component) of the nth listed element in a deliberate way. 4. Conclude that this new element differs from every element in the list, contradicting the assumption of a complete enumeration. The key feature of diagonalization is that the new element disagrees with the nth listed element in the nth component, ensuring that it is distinct from every item in the list. This strategy generalizes beyond decimal expansions. In each case, the heart of the argument is the same: no enumeration can capture every possible object once we can systematically construct one that escapes the list. Corollary 24.1.2. R is uncountable, and |R|= |(0, 1)|. Proof. Define f : (0, 1) →R by f(x) = ln \u00121 −x x \u0013 . Proving that f is a bijection was left as an exercise earlier. Since (0, 1) is uncountable and f is a bijection, it follows that R is also uncountable. Corollary 24.1.3. For any a, b ∈R with a < b, each of the following sets is uncountable: • (a, b) • (a, b] • [a, b) • [a, b] • (−∞, b) • (−∞, b] • (a, ∞) • [a, ∞) 24.1.2. Cantor’s Theorem Our diagonalization argument for the real numbers revealed that (0, 1) cannot be enumerated by the natural numbers. Cantor’s Theorem extends this idea even further: for any set S, the collection of all its subsets—its power set—is strictly larger than S itself. Theorem 24.1.4 (Cantor’s Theorem). For any set S, we have |S|< |P(S)|. 154\n\n Notes. • If S is finite, Cantor’s Theorem can be verified directly. In Homework 7, we proved that |P([n])|= 2n for all n ∈N, and it can be proven by induction that n < 2n for all n ∈N. • For infinite sets S, the theorem implies an infinite hierarchy of distinct infinite cardinalities, obtained by repeatedly taking power sets. For example: |N|< |P(N)|< |P(P(N))|< |P(P(P(N)))|< · · · Proof. Let S be an arbitrary set, and suppose g : S →P(S) is any function. Define a set T ∈P(S) by T = {x ∈S | x /∈g(x)}. We will show that T ̸= g(x) for any x ∈S. Let x ∈S be arbitrary. ▶Case 1: Suppose x ∈T. Then, by definition of T, we have x /∈g(x). Hence x ∈T but x /∈g(x), so T ̸= g(x). ▶Case 2: Suppose x /∈T. Then, by definition of T, we have x ∈g(x). Hence x /∈T but x ∈g(x), so again T ̸= g(x). Thus T ̸= g(x) for every x ∈S, meaning T is not in the image of g. Therefore g is not surjective. Since g : S →P(S) was arbitrary, no surjection from S onto P(S) exists, and hence |S|< |P(S)|. The construction in the proof is another example of diagonalization, where we created a new set T that disagrees with each g(x) regarding the membership of x. Example 24.1.5. To illustrate Cantor’s Theorem for the case S = N, we will show that no surjection f : N →P(N) can exist. Let f : N →P(N) be an arbitrary function, and define T = {n ∈N | n /∈f(n)}. We claim that T is not equal to f(n) for any n ∈N. To get some intuition, let us look at a few examples. • Suppose f(0) = {0, 3}. Then 0 /∈T because 0 ∈f(0), so T ̸= f(0). • Suppose f(1) = {5}. Then 1 ∈T because 1 /∈f(1), so T ̸= f(1). • Suppose f(2) = N. Then 2 /∈T because 2 ∈f(2), so T ̸= f(2). • Suppose f(3) = {1, 2, 4}. Then 3 ∈T because 3 /∈f(3), so T ̸= f(3). In each case, T differs from f(n) at the element n itself. More generally, for any n ∈N, we have two cases: 155\n\n ▶Case 1: If n ∈f(n), then n /∈T, so T ̸= f(n). ▶Case 2: If n /∈f(n), then n ∈T, so T ̸= f(n). Thus, for every n ∈N, the set T differs from f(n) in at least one element—specifically, at the “diagonal position” n. This pattern of constructing a new object that disagrees with the n-th object at the n-th coordinate is the essence of the diagonalization method. Since T ∈P(N) and T ̸= f(n) for all n ∈N, we conclude that f is not a surjection. Therefore, |N|< |P(N)|. Diagonalization thus provides a systematic way to construct an element not listed in any proposed enumeration. 24.1.3. Infinite Binary Sequences The technique used in Cantor’s Theorem also applies to other sets with infinite structure. One important example is the set of all infinite binary sequences. Although this result was proven in recitation, we restate it here to highlight its connection with Cantor’s argument. Theorem 24.1.6. Define {0, 1}N as the set of all infinite sequences consisting of 0s and 1s. That is, {0, 1}N = {⟨ai⟩i∈N | ∀i ∈N, ai ∈{0, 1}} . Then {0, 1}N is uncountably infinite. Cantor’s diagonal argument can be adapted to this setting by assuming we have an enumeration of all infinite binary sequences and then constructing a new sequence that differs from the n-th sequence at its n-th position. The resulting sequence cannot appear in the list, proving that no enumeration can include every element of {0, 1}N. Conceptually, this result is equivalent to Cantor’s Theorem for P(N): each infinite binary sequence can be viewed as the characteristic function of a subset of N. Thus, {0, 1}N and P(N) have the same cardinality, providing another example of how diagonalization exposes uncountable structures. Exercise 24.1.7. Show that the following sets are uncountable. (a) A = {f : N →{0, 1} | f is a function} (b) B = {f : N →N | f is a function} (c) C = {f : N →N | f is a bijection} 156\n\n (d) D = the set of infinite sequences of integers.

Introduction Number theory is possibly the oldest field of mathematics, and much of modern mathematics has its roots in it. The simplest description of number theory is the study of arithmetic. Number theorists investigate the fundamental properties of the integers, exploring their structure and relationships. At the heart of this field lies the study of prime numbers, which play a central role. Many of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics are found in number theory, often characterized by their simplicity to state but difficulty to solve. Examples of Number Theoretic Results and Conjectures 1. There are infinitely many ordered triples of positive integers (x, y, z) such that x2 + y2 = z2. 2. Fermat’s Last Theorem: There are no ordered triples of positive integers (x, y, z) such that xn + yn = zn for any n ≥3. 3. Lagrange’s Four-Square Theorem: Every nonnegative integer can be expressed as the sum of four perfect squares. For example, 35 = 52 + 32 + 12 + 02. 4. Goldbach’s Conjecture: Every even integer greater than 2 can be written as the sum of two prime numbers. For example, 14 = 3 + 11 (or 14 = 7 + 7). 5. Twin Prime Conjecture: There are infinitely many pairs of prime numbers of the form (p, p + 2). To begin our study of number theory, we will first review some relevant definitions and results from earlier sections. • A natural number n > 1 is called prime if its only divisors are 1 and itself. In other words, if n is prime and n = ab for a, b ∈N, then either a = 1 or b = 1 (Lecture 11). • A natural number n > 1 is called composite if there exist a, b ∈N such that 1 < a ≤b < n and n = ab. In other words, n > 1 and is not prime. • The natural number n = 1 is called a unit. 159\n\n • Every natural number n > 1 is either prime or can be expressed as a product of prime numbers (Theorem 11.1.7). We now state a useful result that was proved in class on September 8, and repeat the proof here for reference: Theorem 25.1.1. Let m, n ∈Z be nonzero integers. If m | n, then |m|≤|n|. Proof. Let m, n ∈Z ∖{0} such that m | n. Then there exists an integer a ∈Z such that n = ma. Since the absolute value function is multiplicative, we have |n|= |m|·|a|. Because m and n are nonzero, a ̸= 0, which implies |a|≥1. Therefore, |n|= |m|·|a|≥ |m|·1 = |m|. The following corollary is an immediate consequence of the theorem. Corollary 25.1.2. Let m, n ∈Z. If m | n and n | m, then m = ±n. From the definitions and results above, we know that every composite integer n has a prime factor p < n. In fact, we can say more: every composite integer n has a prime factor p ≤√n. This observation provides a straightforward (though inefficient) method for checking whether a natural number n is prime. Theorem 25.1.3. If n ∈N is composite, then n has a prime factor p such that p ≤√n. Proof. Let n ∈N be composite, and express n as n = ab for some a, b ∈N with 1 < a ≤b < n. We first show that a ≤√n. Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that a > √n. Then n = (√n)2 < a2 ≤ab = n, which yields the contradiction n < n. Therefore, a ≤√n. Let p be any prime divisor of a (possibly a itself, if a is prime). Then p ≤a ≤√n and, since p | a and a | n, it follows by transitivity that p | n. Example 25.1.4. Use the previous theorem to determine whether 91 or 97 is prime. Observe that √ 91 < √ 97 < 10, and the only prime numbers less than 10 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. To determine whether 91 or 97 is prime, we need to check if they are divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7. 160\n\n • It is clear that 2 ∤91 (since 91 is odd) and 5 ∤91 (since 91 does not end in 0 or 5). We also find that 3 ∤91, but we notice that 7 | 91 and 91 = 7 · 13. Thus, 91 is composite . • Similarly, 2 ∤97 and 5 ∤97. Checking for divisibility by 3 and 7, we find that 3 ∤97 and 7 ∤97. Therefore, 97 is prime . Exercise 25.1.5. Determine which of the following integers are primes. (a) 201 (b) 203 (c) 207 (d) 211 (e) 213 (f) 221 161\n\n 26. October 31 26.1. GCDs, LCMs, and Linear Combinations By Theorem 25.1.1, if n is a nonzero integer, then n can have only finitely many divisors, since m | n implies |m|≤|n|. Because any two nonzero integers each have finitely many divisors, it is natural to define the greatest divisor common to both. In fact, we can relax this requirement so that only one of the integers must be nonzero. Definition. For a, b ∈Z, not both zero, an integer d is called a common divisor of a and b if d | a and d | b. Furthermore, d is called the greatest common divisor of a and b, denoted gcd(a, b), if d is the largest of their common divisors. Examples 26.1.1. 1. Consider m = 54 and n = 42. Set of divisors of 54 = {±1, ±2, ±3, ±6, ±9, ±18, ±27, ±54}, Set of divisors of 42 = {±1, ±2, ±3, ±6, ±7, ±14, ±21, ±42}, Set of common divisors = {±1, ±2, ±3, ±6}. Therefore, gcd(54, 42) = 6, the largest element from the set of common divisors. 2. gcd(−6, −15) = 3. Even though both integers are negative, the greatest common divisor is always taken to be positive. 3. gcd(0, 44) = 44. Since every integer divides 0, we have gcd(0, n) = |n| for any integer n ̸= 0. (The value gcd(0, 0) is undefined.) Since the divisors of −m are the same as those of m, it follows that gcd(m, n) = gcd(|m|, |n|). Therefore, we often restrict our attention to pairs of nonnegative integers. Definition. Let a, b ∈Z, not both zero. Then a and b are called relatively prime (or coprime) if gcd(a, b) = 1. The following theorem states that if we divide a and b by their greatest common divisor, then the resulting integers have no common divisors other than ±1. This simple but powerful result is foundational in the study of arithmetic. 162", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

Cartesian Products In set theory, the Cartesian product of two sets provides a way to pair each element of one set with each element of another set. This operation is fundamental in many areas of mathematics, allowing us to construct ordered pairs and define relations and functions. The Cartesian product helps us explore the relationships between different sets in a structured manner.\n\n**Proof:** We will prove both statements simultaneously. Define the set S ⊆Z+ by S = {c ∈Z+ | ∃x, y ∈Z, (ax + by = c)}. Since |a|+|b|∈S, the set S is non-empty. By the Well-Ordering Property, S has a least element. Let d = ma + nb, where m, n ∈Z, be the smallest element of S. To establish both conditions, we need to show that d = gcd(a, b). To show that d | a, let q, r ∈Z be such that 0 ≤r < d and a = dq + r, as guaranteed by the Division Algorithm. Solving for r and substituting d = ma + nb, we get: r = a −dq = a −(ma + nb)q = (1 −qm)a + (−qn)b. Thus, r can be written in the form ax + by, but since r < d, it must be that r /∈S, implying r = 0. Hence, d | a. An identical argument shows that d | b, making d a common divisor of a and b. To show that d is the greatest common divisor, let t ∈Z+ be a common divisor of a and b. Then there exist k, ℓ∈Z such that a = tk and b = tℓ. Substituting these into d = ma + nb, we obtain: d = mtk + ntℓ= t(mk + nℓ). Thus, t | d. Since both t and d are positive, we conclude t ≤d, establishing that d = gcd(a, b). Several useful consequences follow immediately from B´ezout’s Lemma.

GCDs, LCMs, and Linear Combinations 27.1.1. Linear Diophantine Equations A Diophantine equation is a polynomial equation with integer coefficients, typically involving multiple variables, in which the goal is to find integer (or sometimes rational) solutions. The study of such equations forms a central area of research in Number Theory, with applications ranging from cryptography to mathematical puzzles. Diophantine equations come in many forms, varying greatly in difficulty and complexity. In this course, we will focus on a specific type of Diophantine equation called linear Diophantine equations, which involve polynomials of degree one. To motivate our exploration, let’s look at a few examples that illustrate the variety and challenges of Diophantine problems: Examples 27.1.1. 1. Find all (x, y) ∈Z2 such that y2 = x3 + 16. This is an example of a Mordell equation, a type of cubic Diophantine equation. These equations often have only a few integer solutions or none at all. For this particular equation, the only integer solutions are (0, 4) and (0, −4). 2. Find all n ∈Z that can be expressed as the sum of three cubes, i.e., ∃x, y, z ∈Z, n = x3 + y3 + z3. This is an example of a longstanding open problem in number theory. While some values of n have been resolved, finding solutions for all n remains an unsolved challenge. 3. Find all (x, y) ∈Z2 such that 6x + 9y = 27. This is a linear Diophantine equation, which we will study in detail. Unlike the previous examples, linear Diophantine equations can often be solved systematically, and we will develop techniques to find all solutions. 168\n\n A Diophantine equation of the form ax + by = c, where a, b, c ∈Z, is called a linear Diophantine equation in two variables. We know from B´ezout’s lemma that ∃x, y ∈Z such that ax + by = c if and only if gcd(a, b) | c. If a solution exists, we can find one such solution using the Reverse Euclidean Algorithm, as illustrated in Example 26.1.8. First, find x′, y′ ∈Z such that ax′ + by′ = gcd(a, b). For instance, in Example 26.1.8, we found that gcd(148, 40) = 4 = 148(3) + 40(−11). Since gcd(a, b) | c, we can find one solution to ax + by = c by multiplying the equation ax′ + by′ = gcd(a, b) by c gcd(a,b). For instance, if c = 36, then multiplying the previous equation by 9 gives 36 = 148(27) + 40(−99). Now that we know how to find one solution to ax+by = c, how do we find all solutions? Are there others? And if so, how many? Let’s first get a basic idea of how we can use one solution to find all solutions through the following example. Example 27.1.2. Find all integral solutions to 6x + 9y = 21. x, y ∈Z satisfy 6x + 9y = 21 if and only if 2x + 3y = 7 (dividing through by gcd(6, 9)). Thus, it suffices to find all solutions to 2x + 3y = 7. Since the numbers are small, we can guess a solution: 2(2) + 3(1) = 7. Thus, (2, 1) is one solution to the equation. Now, suppose (x, y) ∈Z2 is any solution to 2x + 3y = 7. We then have 2x + 3y = 7 = 2(2) + 3(1). This equation holds if and only if 2(x −2) = 3(1 −y). Let m = x −2 and n = 1 −y, so our equation becomes 2m = 3n. Since 2m is even (and 2 ∤3), it must be the case that 2 | n, hence n = 2k for some k ∈Z. Substituting this into our previous equation gives 2m = 6k =⇒m = 3k. Using m = x −2 and n = 1 −y, we find x = 2 + 3k and y = 1 −2k. Thus, any solution must be of the form (2 + 3k, 1 −2k) for some k ∈Z. Furthermore, we can verify that any ordered pair of this form satisfies the Diophantine equation: 2(2 + 3k) + 3(1 −2k) = 4 + 6k + 3 −6k = 7. Hence, the solution set is {(2 + 3k, 1 −2k) | k ∈Z}. 169\n\n We summarize the result below. The proof, which generalizes the previous example, is left for homework. Theorem 27.1.3. Let a, b, c ∈Z with a and b not both zero. If gcd(a, b) | c, then there are infinitely many integer solutions to ax + by = c. Moreover, if (x0, y0) is one solution, then all solutions are given by {(x0 + m(b/d), y0 −m(a/d)) | m ∈Z, d = gcd(a, b)}. Proof. Homework. Exercise 27.1.4. Find all integer solutions to the following linear Diophantine equations, or state why none exist. (a) 123x + 45y = 17 (b) 123x + 45y = 18 27.1.2. Least Common Multiples We now discuss the concept of the least common multiple, which serves as a natural counterpart to the greatest common divisor. Definition. Let a, b, c ∈Z ∖{0}. We say that c is a common multiple of a and b if a | c and b | c. Furthermore, c is called the least common multiple of a and b, denoted lcm[a, b], if c > 0 and c is the smallest of all positive common multiples of a and b. The following theorem establishes a key property of the least common multiple. Theorem 27.1.5. Let a, b ∈Z, not both zero. For any n ∈Z, we have lcm[a, b] | n if and only if a | n and b | n. Proof. (⇒): Suppose lcm[a, b] | n. Since a | lcm[a, b] and b | lcm[a, b], the transitivity of divisibility implies that a | n and b | n. Thus, n is a common multiple of a and b. (⇐): Suppose a | n and b | n. By the division algorithm, there exist q, r ∈Z with 0 ≤r < lcm[a, b] such that n = q · lcm[a, b] + r. Since a | n and a | lcm[a, b], we have a | (n −q · lcm[a, b]), implying a | r by the properties of divisibility. A similar argument shows that b | r. 170\n\n Since 0 ≤r < lcm[a, b] and r is a common multiple of a and b, it follows that r = 0. Hence, lcm[a, b] | n. The following corollaries capture additional useful properties of the least common multiple. Their proofs are left as exercises. Corollaries 27.1.6. Let a, b ∈Z, not both zero. Then: 1. lcm[a, b] = |b| if and only if a | b. 2. For any m ∈Z+, lcm[ma, mb] = m · lcm[a, b]. Exercise 27.1.7. Prove the previous corollaries. The next theorem establishes a fundamental relationship between the greatest common divisor and the least common multiple. Theorem 27.1.8 (GCD-LCM Theorem). For any positive integers a and b, we have gcd(a, b) · lcm[a, b] = ab. Proof. Homework Note. To compute the least common multiple of two integers, no new algorithm is required. Once the greatest common divisor is known, the least common multiple can be determined directly using the GCD-LCM relationship. 27.2. Prime Factorizations Prime numbers are often referred to as the building blocks of the integers. One of the most significant properties of integers is that every positive integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of prime numbers in exactly one way, up to the order of the factors. This result is known as the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. The decomposition of integers into their prime factors is a powerful tool in mathematics, with applications ranging from simplifying fractions to enabling secure encryption methods. The key result needed to establish this theorem is derived from B´ezout’s Lemma. Theorem 27.2.1 (Euclid’s Lemma). Let a, b, c ∈Z. If a and b are relatively prime (i.e., gcd(a, b) = 1) and a | bc, then a | c. 171\n\n Proof. Let a, b, c ∈Z such that gcd(a, b) = 1 and a | bc. Since gcd(a, b) = 1, B´ezout’s Lemma guarantees the existence of integers m, n ∈Z such that am + bn = 1. Fix such values of m and n. Since a | bc, there exists some k ∈Z such that bc = ak. Multiplying both sides of am + bn = 1 by c gives amc + bnc = c. Substituting bc = ak into the equation, we get c = amc + akn = a(mc + kn). Thus, a | c, as required. The following corollary is a special case of Euclid’s Lemma when a is a prime number. Corollary 27.2.2. Let p, b, c ∈Z with p prime. If p | bc, then p | b or p | c. 172\n\n 28. November 5 28.1. Prime Factorizations We now have the necessary tools to establish the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Theorem 28.1.1 (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic). Every integer n > 1 can be uniquely written as a product of prime numbers, up to the order of the prime factors. In other words, if n = p1 · p2 · · · pr = q1 · q2 · · · qs for prime numbers pi and qj such that p1 ≤p2 ≤· · · ≤pr and q1 ≤q2 ≤· · · ≤qs, then r = s and pi = qi for each i ∈[r]. Proof. Existence – This has already been established in Theorem 11.1.7. Uniqueness – Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a positive integer n such that n > 1 and n has two distinct prime factorizations. Let n0 be the smallest such integer, according to the well-ordering property. Then, there exist positive integers k, ℓ∈Z+ and prime numbers pi and qj for 1 ≤i ≤k and 1 ≤j ≤ℓsuch that n0 = k Y i=1 pi = ℓY j=1 qj. We consider two cases: • Case 1: k = 1 or ℓ= 1. Without loss of generality, assume k = 1. Then n0 = p1 = ℓY j=1 qj. Since p1 is prime, it must be that ℓ= 1 and hence n0 = p1 = q1. This contradicts the assumption that the prime factorizations were distinct. 173\n\n • Case 2: k, ℓ≥2. Since p1 | n0, it follows that p1 | Qℓ j=1 qj. Because p1 is prime, the corollary to Euclid’s Lemma implies that there exists some j ∈[ℓ] such that p1 | qj. By relabeling the qj’s if necessary, we may assume that p1 | q1. This implies that q1 = p1 since q1 is prime. Then n0 p1 is an integer greater than 1, and n0 p1 = k Y i=2 pi = ℓY j=2 qj. Since k, ℓ≥2, this shows that n0 p1 has two distinct prime factorizations. But n0 p1 < n0, contradicting the assumption that n0 was the smallest integer greater than 1 with two distinct prime factorizations. Since these are the only two cases and they both lead to contradictions, we conclude that every integer n > 1 can be written uniquely as a product of primes. Examples 28.1.2. 1. 240 = 2 · 2 · 2 · 2 · 3 · 5 = 24 · 3 · 5. Moreover, this is the only way to factor 240 into a product of prime numbers. Viewing the prime numbers as the building blocks, we see that 240 is composed of 4 copies of 2, 1 copy of 3, and 1 copy of 5. 2. 289 = 17 · 17 = 172 3. 1001 = 7 · 11 · 13 Our next result establishes a fact that we have been assuming implicitly for some time. Corollary 28.1.3 (Infinitude of Primes). There are infinitely many prime numbers. Proof. Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there are only finitely many prime numbers, say n primes for some n ∈Z+. List these primes as p1, p2, . . . , pn. Define P ∈N to be one more than the product of these primes, i.e., P = n Y i=1 pi ! + 1 = p1p2 · · · pn + 1. Since P > 1, the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic implies that P has at least one prime divisor. Given that there are only finitely many primes, it follows that pj | P for some j ∈{1, 2, . . . , n}. Thus, we can write P = pjk for some k ∈Z. 174\n\n However, pj also divides nQ i=1 pi (as pj is one of the factors in the product), so we can express nQ i=1 pi = pjℓfor some ℓ∈Z. Consequently, we have 1 = P − n Y i=1 pi = pj(k −ℓ), which implies pj | 1. This is a contradiction, as no prime number divides 1. Therefore, our original assumption must be false, and there are indeed infinitely many prime numbers. Note. This proof shows that if p1, . . . , pn are the first n prime numbers, then the next prime could be as large as P = n Y i=1 pi ! + 1. However, this is a significant overestimate. For example, this method would imply that p10 ≤223092871, while in reality, p10 = 29. 28.1.1. Divisors Let P be the set of prime numbers. For each p ∈P and n ∈Z+, define vp(n) = max{a ∈N | pa divides n} as the largest power of p dividing n. If a, b, and n are positive integers such that n = ab, then for all p ∈P, we have vp(n) = vp(a) + vp(b). Hence, vp(a) ≤vp(n). This implies that if n has a prime factorization n = pn1 1 pn2 2 · · · pnk k , then we can express a as a = pa1 1 pa2 2 · · · pak k , for some ai where 0 ≤ai ≤ni for each 1 ≤i ≤k. (Note that we allow ai = 0 for any or all values of i.) Since any positive divisor must be of this form, and any integer of this form is indeed a divisor of n, we have now classified all divisors of n. This allows us to count the number of divisors of n. • For an arbitrary divisor a of n, there are ni + 1 possible values for vpi(a). • Since there are k distinct primes in the prime factorization of n, the total number of divisors of n is given by kQ i=1 (ni + 1). 175\n\n GCDs and LCMs Revisited We can use the above ideas to provide an alternative characterization of GCDs and LCMs. Theorem 28.1.4. Let a, b ∈Z be greater than 1. Further, let {p1, . . . , pn} be the set of all prime factors of either a or b. Then we can express a and b as a = n Y i=1 pai i and b = n Y i=1 pbi i , where ai ≥0 and bi ≥0 for 1 ≤i ≤n. Then gcd(a, b) = n Y i=1 pmin{ai,bi} i , lcm[a, b] = n Y i=1 pmax{ai,bi} i . Proof. Let d = gcd(a, b). For each 1 ≤i ≤n, we have vpi(d) ≤ai and vpi(d) ≤bi. Thus, vpi(d) ≤min{ai, bi}. Moreover, nQ i=1 pmin{ai,bi} i divides a, as seen from a = n Y i=1 pmin{ai,bi} i ! n Y i=1 pai−min{ai,bi} i ! . Similarly, nQ i=1 pmin{ai,bi} i divides b. Since d is the greatest common divisor of a and b, we must have vpi(d) = min{ai, bi} for all i. Therefore, d = nQ i=1 pmin{ai,bi} i . A similar argument establishes the result for the least common multiple. Example 28.1.5. Consider the integers 720 and 700. We have 720 = 24 · 32 · 51 · 70, 700 = 22 · 30 · 52 · 71, gcd(720, 700) = 22 · 30 · 51 · 70, lcm[720, 700] = 24 · 32 · 52 · 71. Hence, gcd(720, 700) = 20 and lcm(720, 700) = 25200. The GCD-LCM Theorem 27.1.8 follows immediately from the previous theorem. 176\n\n Corollary 28.1.6 (GCD-LCM Theorem). For all a, b ∈Z+, we have ab = gcd(a, b) · lcm[a, b]. Exercise 28.1.7. (a) Prove that a positive integer n is a perfect square if and only if the exponent of each prime factor of n is even. (b) Prove that if a and b are coprime positive integers and their product is a perfect square, then a and b are themselves perfect squares. (c) Prove that if a and b are positive integers and ab is a perfect square, then a = dm2 and b = dn2 where d = gcd(a, b), for some coprime integers m and n. (d) Reprove the irrationality of √ 2 in the following way: • Assume for the sake of contradiction that √ 2 = a b where a, b ∈Z+ are coprime. Use part (a) to arrive at a contradiction. Exercise 28.1.8. Use the fundamental theorem of arithmetic to prove that 171/3 is irrational. 28.2. Modular Arithmetic Recall: For m ∈Z+ and a, b ∈Z, we say that a is congruent to b modulo m, denoted a ≡b (mod m), if and only if m | (a−b). We proved in Theorem 18.1.3 that congruence modulo m is an equivalence relation. The set of equivalence classes (often called congruence classes in this context) is denoted by Z/mZ = {[a]m | a ∈Z}. In computer science, “mod” is often treated as an operation that takes an integer a as input and returns the remainder r when a is divided by m. As a relation, this means a ≡r (mod m) (equivalently, [a]m = [r]m). This interpretation can be justified by the following theorem. Theorem 28.2.1. For all a, b ∈Z and all m ∈Z+, we have a ≡b (mod m) ⇐⇒a and b have the same remainder when divided by m. Proof. Let a, b ∈Z and m ∈Z+. By the Division Algorithm, there exist unique integers q1, r1, q2, r2 ∈Z such that a = mq1 + r1 and b = mq2 + r2, 177\n\n where 0 ≤r1 < m and 0 ≤r2 < m. We will show that a ≡b (mod m) if and only if r1 = r2. (⇒): Suppose a ≡b (mod m). Then m | (a −b), so there exists k ∈Z such that a −b = mk. Substituting our expressions for a and b, we get mk = m(q1 −q2) + (r1 −r2). Solving for r1 −r2 gives r1 −r2 = m(k −(q1 −q2)), which shows that m | (r1 −r2). Since 0 ≤r1, r2 < m, we have −m < r1 −r2 < m, and the only multiple of m in this range is 0. Hence r1 −r2 = 0, so r1 = r2. (⇐): Suppose r1 = r2. Then a −b = m(q1 −q2), which implies m | (a −b), and therefore a ≡b (mod m). The following corollary is immediate. Corollary 28.2.2. Let m ∈Z+. Every integer is congruent to exactly one element of the set {0, 1, . . . , m −1} modulo m. Equivalently, Z/mZ = {[0]m, [1]m, . . . , [m −1]m}. The set {0, 1, . . . , m−1} is an example of what we call a complete set of residues modulo m. Definition. For m ∈Z+, a set {a1, . . . , am} ⊂Z is called a complete set of residues modulo m if every integer is congruent to exactly one element of {a1, . . . , am} modulo m. Examples 28.2.3. There are infinitely many complete sets of residues modulo m, but some are more commonly used than others. • Least Nonnegative Residues modulo m: {0, 1, . . . , m −1}. • Least Positive Residues modulo m: {1, 2, . . . , m}. • Least Absolute Residues modulo m: ▶If m is odd: {0, 1, −1, 2, −2, . . . , m−1 2 , −m−1 2 }. ▶If m is even: {0, 1, −1, 2, −2, . . . , m−2 2 , −m−2 2 , m 2 }. 178", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

Define the set S ⊆Z+ by S = {c ∈Z+ | ∃x, y ∈Z, (ax + by = c)}. Since |a|+|b|∈S, the set S is non-empty. By the Well-Ordering Property, S has a least element. Let d = ma + nb, where m, n ∈Z, be the smallest element of S. To establish both conditions, we need to show that d = gcd(a, b). To show that d | a, let q, r ∈Z be such that 0 ≤r < d and a = dq + r, as guaranteed by the Division Algorithm. Solving for r and substituting d = ma + nb, we get: r = a −dq = a −(ma + nb)q = (1 −qm)a + (−qn)b. Thus, r can be written in the form ax + by, but since r < d, it must be that r /∈S, implying r = 0. Hence, d | a. An identical argument shows that d | b, making d a common divisor of a and b. To show that d is the greatest common divisor, let t ∈Z+ be a common divisor of a and b. Then there exist k, ℓ∈Z such that a = tk and b = tℓ. Substituting these into d = ma + nb, we obtain: d = mtk + ntℓ= t(mk + nℓ). Thus, t | d. Since both t and d are positive, we conclude t ≤d, establishing that d = gcd(a, b). Several useful consequences follow immediately from B´ezout’s Lemma.

GCDs, LCMs, and Linear Combinations 27.1.1. Linear Diophantine Equations A Diophantine equation is a polynomial equation with integer coefficients, typically involving multiple variables, in which the goal is to find integer (or sometimes rational) solutions. The study of such equations forms a central area of research in Number Theory, with applications ranging from cryptography to mathematical puzzles. Diophantine equations come in many forms, varying greatly in difficulty and complexity. In this course, we will focus on a specific type of Diophantine equation called linear Diophantine equations, which involve polynomials of degree one. To motivate our exploration, let’s look at a few examples that illustrate the variety and challenges of Diophantine problems: Examples 27.1.1. 1. Find all (x, y) ∈Z2 such that y2 = x3 + 16. This is an example of a Mordell equation, a type of cubic Diophantine equation. These equations often have only a few integer solutions or none at all. For this particular equation, the only integer solutions are (0, 4) and (0, −4). 2. Find all n ∈Z that can be expressed as the sum of three cubes, i.e., ∃x, y, z ∈Z, n = x3 + y3 + z3. This is an example of a longstanding open problem in number theory. While some values of n have been resolved, finding solutions for all n remains an unsolved challenge. 3. Find all (x, y) ∈Z2 such that 6x + 9y = 27. This is a linear Diophantine equation, which we will study in detail. Unlike the previous examples, linear Diophantine equations can often be solved systematically, and we will develop techniques to find all solutions. 168\n\n A Diophantine equation of the form ax + by = c, where a, b, c ∈Z, is called a linear Diophantine equation in two variables. We know from B´ezout’s lemma that ∃x, y ∈Z such that ax + by = c if and only if gcd(a, b) | c. If a solution exists, we can find one such solution using the Reverse Euclidean Algorithm, as illustrated in Example 26.1.8. First, find x′, y′ ∈Z such that ax′ + by′ = gcd(a, b). For instance, in Example 26.1.8, we found that gcd(148, 40) = 4 = 148(3) + 40(−11). Since gcd(a, b) | c, we can find one solution to ax + by = c by multiplying the equation ax′ + by′ = gcd(a, b) by c gcd(a,b). For instance, if c = 36, then multiplying the previous equation by 9 gives 36 = 148(27) + 40(−99). Now that we know how to find one solution to ax+by = c, how do we find all solutions? Are there others? And if so, how many? Let’s first get a basic idea of how we can use one solution to find all solutions through the following example. Example 27.1.2. Find all integral solutions to 6x + 9y = 21. x, y ∈Z satisfy 6x + 9y = 21 if and only if 2x + 3y = 7 (dividing through by gcd(6, 9)). Thus, it suffices to find all solutions to 2x + 3y = 7. Since the numbers are small, we can guess a solution: 2(2) + 3(1) = 7. Thus, (2, 1) is one solution to the equation. Now, suppose (x, y) ∈Z2 is any solution to 2x + 3y = 7. We then have 2x + 3y = 7 = 2(2) + 3(1). This equation holds if and only if 2(x −2) = 3(1 −y). Let m = x −2 and n = 1 −y, so our equation becomes 2m = 3n. Since 2m is even (and 2 ∤3), it must be the case that 2 | n, hence n = 2k for some k ∈Z. Substituting this into our previous equation gives 2m = 6k =⇒m = 3k. Using m = x −2 and n = 1 −y, we find x = 2 + 3k and y = 1 −2k. Thus, any solution must be of the form (2 + 3k, 1 −2k) for some k ∈Z. Furthermore, we can verify that any ordered pair of this form satisfies the Diophantine equation: 2(2 + 3k) + 3(1 −2k) = 4 + 6k + 3 −6k = 7. Hence, the solution set is {(2 + 3k, 1 −2k) | k ∈Z}. 169\n\n We summarize the result below. The proof, which generalizes the previous example, is left for homework. Theorem 27.1.3. Let a, b, c ∈Z with a and b not both zero. If gcd(a, b) | c, then there are infinitely many integer solutions to ax + by = c. Moreover, if (x0, y0) is one solution, then all solutions are given by {(x0 + m(b/d), y0 −m(a/d)) | m ∈Z, d = gcd(a, b)}. Proof. Homework. Exercise 27.1.4. Find all integer solutions to the following linear Diophantine equations, or state why none exist. (a) 123x + 45y = 17 (b) 123x + 45y = 18 27.1.2. Least Common Multiples We now discuss the concept of the least common multiple, which serves as a natural counterpart to the greatest common divisor. Definition. Let a, b, c ∈Z ∖{0}. We say that c is a common multiple of a and b if a | c and b | c. Furthermore, c is called the least common multiple of a and b, denoted lcm[a, b], if c > 0 and c is the smallest of all positive common multiples of a and b. The following theorem establishes a key property of the least common multiple. Theorem 27.1.5. Let a, b ∈Z, not both zero. For any n ∈Z, we have lcm[a, b] | n if and only if a | n and b | n. Proof. (⇒): Suppose lcm[a, b] | n. Since a | lcm[a, b] and b | lcm[a, b], the transitivity of divisibility implies that a | n and b | n. Thus, n is a common multiple of a and b. (⇐): Suppose a | n and b | n. By the division algorithm, there exist q, r ∈Z with 0 ≤r < lcm[a, b] such that n = q · lcm[a, b] + r. Since a | n and a | lcm[a, b], we have a | (n −q · lcm[a, b]), implying a | r by the properties of divisibility. A similar argument shows that b | r. 170\n\n Since 0 ≤r < lcm[a, b] and r is a common multiple of a and b, it follows that r = 0. Hence, lcm[a, b] | n. The following corollaries capture additional useful properties of the least common multiple. Their proofs are left as exercises. Corollaries 27.1.6. Let a, b ∈Z, not both zero. Then: 1. lcm[a, b] = |b| if and only if a | b. 2. For any m ∈Z+, lcm[ma, mb] = m · lcm[a, b]. Exercise 27.1.7. Prove the previous corollaries. The next theorem establishes a fundamental relationship between the greatest common divisor and the least common multiple. Theorem 27.1.8 (GCD-LCM Theorem). For any positive integers a and b, we have gcd(a, b) · lcm[a, b] = ab. Proof. Homework Note. To compute the least common multiple of two integers, no new algorithm is required. Once the greatest common divisor is known, the least common multiple can be determined directly using the GCD-LCM relationship. 27.2. Prime Factorizations Prime numbers are often referred to as the building blocks of the integers. One of the most significant properties of integers is that every positive integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of prime numbers in exactly one way, up to the order of the factors. This result is known as the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. The decomposition of integers into their prime factors is a powerful tool in mathematics, with applications ranging from simplifying fractions to enabling secure encryption methods. The key result needed to establish this theorem is derived from B´ezout’s Lemma. Theorem 27.2.1 (Euclid’s Lemma). Let a, b, c ∈Z. If a and b are relatively prime (i.e., gcd(a, b) = 1) and a | bc, then a | c. 171\n\n Proof. Let a, b, c ∈Z such that gcd(a, b) = 1 and a | bc. Since gcd(a, b) = 1, B´ezout’s Lemma guarantees the existence of integers m, n ∈Z such that am + bn = 1. Fix such values of m and n. Since a | bc, there exists some k ∈Z such that bc = ak. Multiplying both sides of am + bn = 1 by c gives amc + bnc = c. Substituting bc = ak into the equation, we get c = amc + akn = a(mc + kn). Thus, a | c, as required. The following corollary is a special case of Euclid’s Lemma when a is a prime number. Corollary 27.2.2. Let p, b, c ∈Z with p prime. If p | bc, then p | b or p | c. 172\n\n 28. November 5 28.1. Prime Factorizations We now have the necessary tools to establish the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Theorem 28.1.1 (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic). Every integer n > 1 can be uniquely written as a product of prime numbers, up to the order of the prime factors. In other words, if n = p1 · p2 · · · pr = q1 · q2 · · · qs for prime numbers pi and qj such that p1 ≤p2 ≤· · · ≤pr and q1 ≤q2 ≤· · · ≤qs, then r = s and pi = qi for each i ∈[r]. Proof. Existence – This has already been established in Theorem 11.1.7. Uniqueness – Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a positive integer n such that n > 1 and n has two distinct prime factorizations. Let n0 be the smallest such integer, according to the well-ordering property. Then, there exist positive integers k, ℓ∈Z+ and prime numbers pi and qj for 1 ≤i ≤k and 1 ≤j ≤ℓsuch that n0 = k Y i=1 pi = ℓY j=1 qj. We consider two cases: • Case 1: k = 1 or ℓ= 1. Without loss of generality, assume k = 1. Then n0 = p1 = ℓY j=1 qj. Since p1 is prime, it must be that ℓ= 1 and hence n0 = p1 = q1. This contradicts the assumption that the prime factorizations were distinct. 173\n\n • Case 2: k, ℓ≥2. Since p1 | n0, it follows that p1 | Qℓ j=1 qj. Because p1 is prime, the corollary to Euclid’s Lemma implies that there exists some j ∈[ℓ] such that p1 | qj. By relabeling the qj’s if necessary, we may assume that p1 | q1. This implies that q1 = p1 since q1 is prime. Then n0 p1 is an integer greater than 1, and n0 p1 = k Y i=2 pi = ℓY j=2 qj. Since k, ℓ≥2, this shows that n0 p1 has two distinct prime factorizations. But n0 p1 < n0, contradicting the assumption that n0 was the smallest integer greater than 1 with two distinct prime factorizations. Since these are the only two cases and they both lead to contradictions, we conclude that every integer n > 1 can be written uniquely as a product of primes. Examples 28.1.2. 1. 240 = 2 · 2 · 2 · 2 · 3 · 5 = 24 · 3 · 5. Moreover, this is the only way to factor 240 into a product of prime numbers. Viewing the prime numbers as the building blocks, we see that 240 is composed of 4 copies of 2, 1 copy of 3, and 1 copy of 5. 2. 289 = 17 · 17 = 172 3. 1001 = 7 · 11 · 13 Our next result establishes a fact that we have been assuming implicitly for some time. Corollary 28.1.3 (Infinitude of Primes). There are infinitely many prime numbers. Proof. Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there are only finitely many prime numbers, say n primes for some n ∈Z+. List these primes as p1, p2, . . . , pn. Define P ∈N to be one more than the product of these primes, i.e., P = n Y i=1 pi ! + 1 = p1p2 · · · pn + 1. Since P > 1, the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic implies that P has at least one prime divisor. Given that there are only finitely many primes, it follows that pj | P for some j ∈{1, 2, . . . , n}. Thus, we can write P = pjk for some k ∈Z. 174\n\n However, pj also divides nQ i=1 pi (as pj is one of the factors in the product), so we can express nQ i=1 pi = pjℓfor some ℓ∈Z. Consequently, we have 1 = P − n Y i=1 pi = pj(k −ℓ), which implies pj | 1. This is a contradiction, as no prime number divides 1. Therefore, our original assumption must be false, and there are indeed infinitely many prime numbers. Note. This proof shows that if p1, . . . , pn are the first n prime numbers, then the next prime could be as large as P = n Y i=1 pi ! + 1. However, this is a significant overestimate. For example, this method would imply that p10 ≤223092871, while in reality, p10 = 29. 28.1.1. Divisors Let P be the set of prime numbers. For each p ∈P and n ∈Z+, define vp(n) = max{a ∈N | pa divides n} as the largest power of p dividing n. If a, b, and n are positive integers such that n = ab, then for all p ∈P, we have vp(n) = vp(a) + vp(b). Hence, vp(a) ≤vp(n). This implies that if n has a prime factorization n = pn1 1 pn2 2 · · · pnk k , then we can express a as a = pa1 1 pa2 2 · · · pak k , for some ai where 0 ≤ai ≤ni for each 1 ≤i ≤k. (Note that we allow ai = 0 for any or all values of i.) Since any positive divisor must be of this form, and any integer of this form is indeed a divisor of n, we have now classified all divisors of n. This allows us to count the number of divisors of n. • For an arbitrary divisor a of n, there are ni + 1 possible values for vpi(a). • Since there are k distinct primes in the prime factorization of n, the total number of divisors of n is given by kQ i=1 (ni + 1). 175\n\n GCDs and LCMs Revisited We can use the above ideas to provide an alternative characterization of GCDs and LCMs. Theorem 28.1.4. Let a, b ∈Z be greater than 1. Further, let {p1, . . . , pn} be the set of all prime factors of either a or b. Then we can express a and b as a = n Y i=1 pai i and b = n Y i=1 pbi i , where ai ≥0 and bi ≥0 for 1 ≤i ≤n. Then gcd(a, b) = n Y i=1 pmin{ai,bi} i , lcm[a, b] = n Y i=1 pmax{ai,bi} i . Proof. Let d = gcd(a, b). For each 1 ≤i ≤n, we have vpi(d) ≤ai and vpi(d) ≤bi. Thus, vpi(d) ≤min{ai, bi}. Moreover, nQ i=1 pmin{ai,bi} i divides a, as seen from a = n Y i=1 pmin{ai,bi} i ! n Y i=1 pai−min{ai,bi} i ! . Similarly, nQ i=1 pmin{ai,bi} i divides b. Since d is the greatest common divisor of a and b, we must have vpi(d) = min{ai, bi} for all i. Therefore, d = nQ i=1 pmin{ai,bi} i . A similar argument establishes the result for the least common multiple. Example 28.1.5. Consider the integers 720 and 700. We have 720 = 24 · 32 · 51 · 70, 700 = 22 · 30 · 52 · 71, gcd(720, 700) = 22 · 30 · 51 · 70, lcm[720, 700] = 24 · 32 · 52 · 71. Hence, gcd(720, 700) = 20 and lcm(720, 700) = 25200. The GCD-LCM Theorem 27.1.8 follows immediately from the previous theorem. 176\n\n Corollary 28.1.6 (GCD-LCM Theorem). For all a, b ∈Z+, we have ab = gcd(a, b) · lcm[a, b]. Exercise 28.1.7. (a) Prove that a positive integer n is a perfect square if and only if the exponent of each prime factor of n is even. (b) Prove that if a and b are coprime positive integers and their product is a perfect square, then a and b are themselves perfect squares. (c) Prove that if a and b are positive integers and ab is a perfect square, then a = dm2 and b = dn2 where d = gcd(a, b), for some coprime integers m and n. (d) Reprove the irrationality of √ 2 in the following way: • Assume for the sake of contradiction that √ 2 = a b where a, b ∈Z+ are coprime. Use part (a) to arrive at a contradiction. Exercise 28.1.8. Use the fundamental theorem of arithmetic to prove that 171/3 is irrational. 28.2. Modular Arithmetic Recall: For m ∈Z+ and a, b ∈Z, we say that a is congruent to b modulo m, denoted a ≡b (mod m), if and only if m | (a−b). We proved in Theorem 18.1.3 that congruence modulo m is an equivalence relation. The set of equivalence classes (often called congruence classes in this context) is denoted by Z/mZ = {[a]m | a ∈Z}. In computer science, “mod” is often treated as an operation that takes an integer a as input and returns the remainder r when a is divided by m. As a relation, this means a ≡r (mod m) (equivalently, [a]m = [r]m). This interpretation can be justified by the following theorem. Theorem 28.2.1. For all a, b ∈Z and all m ∈Z+, we have a ≡b (mod m) ⇐⇒a and b have the same remainder when divided by m. Proof. Let a, b ∈Z and m ∈Z+. By the Division Algorithm, there exist unique integers q1, r1, q2, r2 ∈Z such that a = mq1 + r1 and b = mq2 + r2, 177\n\n where 0 ≤r1 < m and 0 ≤r2 < m. We will show that a ≡b (mod m) if and only if r1 = r2. (⇒): Suppose a ≡b (mod m). Then m | (a −b), so there exists k ∈Z such that a −b = mk. Substituting our expressions for a and b, we get mk = m(q1 −q2) + (r1 −r2). Solving for r1 −r2 gives r1 −r2 = m(k −(q1 −q2)), which shows that m | (r1 −r2). Since 0 ≤r1, r2 < m, we have −m < r1 −r2 < m, and the only multiple of m in this range is 0. Hence r1 −r2 = 0, so r1 = r2. (⇐): Suppose r1 = r2. Then a −b = m(q1 −q2), which implies m | (a −b), and therefore a ≡b (mod m). The following corollary is immediate. Corollary 28.2.2. Let m ∈Z+. Every integer is congruent to exactly one element of the set {0, 1, . . . , m −1} modulo m. Equivalently, Z/mZ = {[0]m, [1]m, . . . , [m −1]m}. The set {0, 1, . . . , m−1} is an example of what we call a complete set of residues modulo m. Definition. For m ∈Z+, a set {a1, . . . , am} ⊂Z is called a complete set of residues modulo m if every integer is congruent to exactly one element of {a1, . . . , am} modulo m. Examples 28.2.3. There are infinitely many complete sets of residues modulo m, but some are more commonly used than others. • Least Nonnegative Residues modulo m: {0, 1, . . . , m −1}. • Least Positive Residues modulo m: {1, 2, . . . , m}. • Least Absolute Residues modulo m: ▶If m is odd: {0, 1, −1, 2, −2, . . . , m−1 2 , −m−1 2 }. ▶If m is even: {0, 1, −1, 2, −2, . . . , m−2 2 , −m−2 2 , m 2 }. 178", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

The Rational Numbers Q is used to denote the “set of all rational numbers”. That is Q = na b | a, b ∈Z and b ̸= 0 o On a number line, Q represents the set of points obtained by dividing any unit segment into an equal number of parts. For example, dividing each unit into 3 equal parts gives a subset of the rational numbers, as illustrated below. Recall that addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of rational numbers are defined in terms of addition and multiplication of integers: a b + c d = ad + bc bd and a b · c d = ac bd 17\n\n Thus, many properties of the rational numbers can be derived from our assumed properties of the integers. Proposition 3.1.5. The following properties hold for rational numbers: 1. The sum (or difference) of two rational numbers is a rational number. 2. The product of two rational numbers is a rational number. 3. The quotient of two rational numbers, where the divisor is nonzero, is a rational number. We will prove property 1 below. The other properties follow similarly and are left as exercises for the reader.\n\n**Proof:** Let a, b, c, d ∈Z and m ∈Z+. Suppose a ≡b (mod m) and c ≡d (mod m). Then m | (a −b) and m | (c −d), so there exist integers k, ℓ∈Z such that a −b = mk and c −d = mℓ. We now verify each claim. 1. Using a −b = mk and c −d = mℓ, we find (a ± c) −(b ± d) = (a −b) ± (c −d) = mk ± mℓ= m(k ± ℓ). Hence m | (a ± c −(b ± d)), so a ± c ≡b ± d (mod m). 2. Substituting a = b + mk and c = d + mℓ, we have ac = (b + mk)(d + mℓ) = bd + m(kd + ℓb + mkℓ). Thus m | (ac −bd), so ac ≡bd (mod m). Remark. Another way to interpret Theorem 29.1.1 is that we have defined addition and multiplication on Z/mZ by [a]m + [b]m = [a + b]m, [a]m · [b]m = [ab]m. 180\n\n The Modular Arithmetic Lemma guarantees that these operations are well-defined: the results do not depend on the choice of representatives for the equivalence classes. Consequently, Z/mZ carries a natural algebraic structure. Let us now explore some examples illustrating what we can and cannot do as a result of the Modular Arithmetic Lemma. Examples 29.1.2. • For x ∈Z, x + 10 ≡x + 3 (mod 7) since 10 ≡3 (mod 7). This shows that we can reduce the constants appearing in a sum modulo 7. • For x, y ∈Z, if x ≡y (mod 7), then x+3 ≡y+3 (mod 7). This demonstrates that we can add the same number to both sides of a congruence, just as with ordinary equations, and the equivalence remains valid. • For x, y ∈Z, if x + 3 ≡y (mod 7), then x ≡y −3 (mod 7). We can therefore subtract the same number from both sides of a congruence and maintain the equivalence. Moreover, since −3 ≡4 (mod 7), we could also write x ≡y + 4 (mod 7). • For x ∈Z, if x ≡3 (mod 7), then 2x ≡6 (mod 7). This shows that we can multiply both sides of a congruence by 2 without breaking equivalence. Since 6 ≡−1 (mod 7), this can also be written as 2x ≡−1 (mod 7). The following corollary follows from a straightforward induction argument, which we leave to the reader. Corollary 29.1.3. Let m ∈Z+ and a, b ∈Z. If a ≡b (mod m), then an ≡bn (mod m) for all n ∈Z+. Exercise 29.1.4. Prove that 4n ≡1 + 3n (mod 9) for all n ∈N. 29.1.1. The Problem with Division We have established that addition, subtraction, and multiplication are well-defined operations modulo m, but division remains problematic. The following examples illustrate why: • If 2x ≡1 (mod m), we cannot conclude that x ≡ 1 2 (mod m), since 1 2 /∈Z, and congruences modulo m are defined only over integers. (Recall that it is an equivalence relation on Z.) • If 6x ≡21 (mod m), we cannot divide both sides by 3 directly. For example, 6 ≡21 (mod 15), but 2 ̸≡7 (mod 15). However, we do have 2 ≡7 (mod 15 3 ). 181\n\n The next theorem clarifies how certain forms of division can still be managed within modular arithmetic. Theorem 29.1.5 (Cancellation Law). For a, b, c ∈Z and m ∈Z+, if d = gcd(c, m) and ac ≡bc (mod m), then a ≡b (mod m d ). Proof. Let a, b, c ∈Z and m ∈Z+. Assume ac ≡bc (mod m), which implies that m | (ac−bc), or equivalently, c(a−b) = mk for some k ∈Z. Let d = gcd(c, m). Dividing both sides of the equation by d, we obtain \u0010 c d \u0011 (a −b) = \u0010m d \u0011 k. Thus, m d | \u0000 c d \u0001 (a −b). By Theorem 26.1.2, we know that gcd \u0000 c d, m d \u0001 = 1, so by Euclid’s Lemma it follows that m d | (a −b). Hence, a ≡b (mod m d ). Example 29.1.6. • Consider the congruence 24x ≡18y (mod 45). We wish to divide both sides by 6 to simplify. Since gcd(6, 45) = 3, the modulus reduces by this factor, yielding 4x ≡3y (mod 15). • For 24x ≡18y (mod 46), we have gcd(6, 46) = 2, so dividing by 6 gives 4x ≡3y (mod 23). • Finally, if 24x ≡18y (mod 47), then gcd(6, 47) = 1 (since 47 is prime). In this case, the modulus remains unchanged: 4x ≡3y (mod 47). Exercise 29.1.7. Let m ∈Z+ and a, b ∈Z with gcd(a, m) = 1. (a) Prove that for all k, ℓ∈Z, k ≡ℓ(mod m) if and only if ak ≡aℓ(mod m). (b) Prove that the following set forms a complete set of residues modulo m. {n ∈Z | ∃k ∈[m], n = ak + b} 29.1.2. Multiplicative Inverses There is another analogue of division in modular arithmetic that applies when the divisor has certain properties. Recall that for a nonzero real number x, dividing by x is equivalent to multiplying by its multiplicative inverse y = 1 x, where xy = 1. The number 182\n\n y is called the multiplicative inverse of x because their product equals one. We now wish to generalize this idea to congruences modulo m. We investigate multiplicative inverses in Z/mZ. Let m ∈Z+ and a ∈Z. We ask: under what conditions does [a]m have a multiplicative inverse in Z/mZ? Equivalently, for which integers a does there exist an integer b such that ab ≡1 (mod m)? If such a b exists, we denote it by b ≡a−1 (mod m). Note that a−1 does not represent the rational number 1 a (which may not be an integer); instead, it denotes the multiplicative inverse of a modulo m. This notation parallels that used for inverses of bijections. Theorem 29.1.8 (MIRP Theorem). Let m ∈Z+ and a ∈Z. Then a and m are relatively prime if and only if there exists b ∈Z such that ab ≡1 (mod m). Equivalently, gcd(a, m) = 1 if and only if [a]m has a multiplicative inverse in Z/mZ. Before proving the theorem, let us consider a few examples. Examples 29.1.9. • There is no solution to 6x ≡1 (mod 21) because gcd(6, 21) = 3 ̸= 1. • There is a solution to 5x ≡1 (mod 21) since gcd(5, 21) = 1. Indeed, 5 · 17 = 85 ≡1 (mod 21). Thus, 5−1 ≡17 (mod 21). By the Modular Arithmetic Lemma (Theorem 29.1.1), the congruence 5x ≡1 (mod 21) holds for all x ∈[17]21. Alternatively, we can express this multiplicative inverse in Z/21Z as [5]21 · [17]21 = [1]21. We now proceed with the proof of the MIRP Theorem. Proof. Let m ∈Z+ and a ∈Z. (⇒): Suppose gcd(a, m) = 1. By B´ezout’s Lemma, there exist integers k, ℓsuch that ak + mℓ= 1. Fix such k, ℓ. Then ak + mℓ≡ak (mod m), so ak ≡1 (mod m). Hence, a has a multiplicative inverse modulo m. (⇐): Conversely, assume there exists k ∈Z such that ak ≡1 (mod m). Then m | (ak −1), so ak −1 = mℓfor some ℓ∈Z. Rearranging gives ak + m(−ℓ) = 1, which implies gcd(a, m) = 1 by B´ezout’s Lemma, since 1 is a linear combination of a and m. 183\n\n The following corollary states that if a multiplicative inverse exists, it is unique modulo m. Corollary 29.1.10. Let m ∈Z+ and a ∈Z such that gcd(a, m) = 1. If k, ℓ∈Z satisfy ak ≡1 (mod m) and aℓ≡1 (mod m), then k ≡ℓ(mod m). Example 29.1.11. Find all x ∈Z such that 4x ≡5 (mod 7). First, note that 4 is invertible modulo 7 since gcd(4, 7) = 1. We find that 4−1 ≡2 (mod 7) because 4 · 2 = 8 ≡1 (mod 7). Now, let x ∈Z satisfy 4x ≡5 (mod 7). Multiplying both sides by 2 gives 2 · 4x ≡2 · 5 (mod 7). Simplifying, we obtain x ≡3 (mod 7). Therefore, the set of solutions is {x ∈Z | 4x ≡5 (mod 7)} = [3]7. The following corollary characterizes when a linear congruence modulo m has a solution. Corollary 29.1.12. Let a, b ∈Z and m ∈Z+. The congruence ax ≡b (mod m) has a solution if and only if gcd(a, m) | b. Proof. You will work through this proof in recitation. Finding Multiplicative Inverses Question: Given gcd(a, m) = 1, how do we find a multiplicative inverse of a modulo m? Answer: There are several ways to do this. 1 Mental Math. If m is small, the most efficient method may be to solve mentally or use guess-andcheck, since there are only a few possible residues. 184", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

For a, b, c ∈Z and m ∈Z+, if d = gcd(c, m) and ac ≡bc (mod m), then a ≡b (mod m d ). Proof. Let a, b, c ∈Z and m ∈Z+. Assume ac ≡bc (mod m), which implies that m | (ac−bc), or equivalently, c(a−b) = mk for some k ∈Z. Let d = gcd(c, m). Dividing both sides of the equation by d, we obtain \u0010 c d \u0011 (a −b) = \u0010m d \u0011 k. Thus, m d | \u0000 c d \u0001 (a −b). By Theorem 26.1.2, we know that gcd \u0000 c d, m d \u0001 = 1, so by Euclid’s Lemma it follows that m d | (a −b). Hence, a ≡b (mod m d ). Example 29.1.6. • Consider the congruence 24x ≡18y (mod 45). We wish to divide both sides by 6 to simplify. Since gcd(6, 45) = 3, the modulus reduces by this factor, yielding 4x ≡3y (mod 15). • For 24x ≡18y (mod 46), we have gcd(6, 46) = 2, so dividing by 6 gives 4x ≡3y (mod 23). • Finally, if 24x ≡18y (mod 47), then gcd(6, 47) = 1 (since 47 is prime). In this case, the modulus remains unchanged: 4x ≡3y (mod 47). Exercise 29.1.7. Let m ∈Z+ and a, b ∈Z with gcd(a, m) = 1. (a) Prove that for all k, ℓ∈Z, k ≡ℓ(mod m) if and only if ak ≡aℓ(mod m). (b) Prove that the following set forms a complete set of residues modulo m. {n ∈Z | ∃k ∈[m], n = ak + b} 29.1.2. Multiplicative Inverses There is another analogue of division in modular arithmetic that applies when the divisor has certain properties. Recall that for a nonzero real number x, dividing by x is equivalent to multiplying by its multiplicative inverse y = 1 x, where xy = 1. The number 182\n\n y is called the multiplicative inverse of x because their product equals one. We now wish to generalize this idea to congruences modulo m. We investigate multiplicative inverses in Z/mZ. Let m ∈Z+ and a ∈Z. We ask: under what conditions does [a]m have a multiplicative inverse in Z/mZ? Equivalently, for which integers a does there exist an integer b such that ab ≡1 (mod m)? If such a b exists, we denote it by b ≡a−1 (mod m). Note that a−1 does not represent the rational number 1 a (which may not be an integer); instead, it denotes the multiplicative inverse of a modulo m. This notation parallels that used for inverses of bijections. Theorem 29.1.8 (MIRP Theorem). Let m ∈Z+ and a ∈Z. Then a and m are relatively prime if and only if there exists b ∈Z such that ab ≡1 (mod m). Equivalently, gcd(a, m) = 1 if and only if [a]m has a multiplicative inverse in Z/mZ. Before proving the theorem, let us consider a few examples. Examples 29.1.9. • There is no solution to 6x ≡1 (mod 21) because gcd(6, 21) = 3 ̸= 1. • There is a solution to 5x ≡1 (mod 21) since gcd(5, 21) = 1. Indeed, 5 · 17 = 85 ≡1 (mod 21). Thus, 5−1 ≡17 (mod 21). By the Modular Arithmetic Lemma (Theorem 29.1.1), the congruence 5x ≡1 (mod 21) holds for all x ∈[17]21. Alternatively, we can express this multiplicative inverse in Z/21Z as [5]21 · [17]21 = [1]21. We now proceed with the proof of the MIRP Theorem. Proof. Let m ∈Z+ and a ∈Z. (⇒): Suppose gcd(a, m) = 1. By B´ezout’s Lemma, there exist integers k, ℓsuch that ak + mℓ= 1. Fix such k, ℓ. Then ak + mℓ≡ak (mod m), so ak ≡1 (mod m). Hence, a has a multiplicative inverse modulo m. (⇐): Conversely, assume there exists k ∈Z such that ak ≡1 (mod m). Then m | (ak −1), so ak −1 = mℓfor some ℓ∈Z. Rearranging gives ak + m(−ℓ) = 1, which implies gcd(a, m) = 1 by B´ezout’s Lemma, since 1 is a linear combination of a and m. 183\n\n The following corollary states that if a multiplicative inverse exists, it is unique modulo m. Corollary 29.1.10. Let m ∈Z+ and a ∈Z such that gcd(a, m) = 1. If k, ℓ∈Z satisfy ak ≡1 (mod m) and aℓ≡1 (mod m), then k ≡ℓ(mod m). Example 29.1.11. Find all x ∈Z such that 4x ≡5 (mod 7). First, note that 4 is invertible modulo 7 since gcd(4, 7) = 1. We find that 4−1 ≡2 (mod 7) because 4 · 2 = 8 ≡1 (mod 7). Now, let x ∈Z satisfy 4x ≡5 (mod 7). Multiplying both sides by 2 gives 2 · 4x ≡2 · 5 (mod 7). Simplifying, we obtain x ≡3 (mod 7). Therefore, the set of solutions is {x ∈Z | 4x ≡5 (mod 7)} = [3]7. The following corollary characterizes when a linear congruence modulo m has a solution. Corollary 29.1.12. Let a, b ∈Z and m ∈Z+. The congruence ax ≡b (mod m) has a solution if and only if gcd(a, m) | b. Proof. You will work through this proof in recitation. Finding Multiplicative Inverses Question: Given gcd(a, m) = 1, how do we find a multiplicative inverse of a modulo m? Answer: There are several ways to do this. 1 Mental Math. If m is small, the most efficient method may be to solve mentally or use guess-andcheck, since there are only a few possible residues. 184", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

For any i, j ∈{0, 1, 2, . . . , p −1}, we have ai ≡aj (mod p) if and only if i ≡j (mod p) by the Cancellation Law, since gcd(a, p) = 1. Thus, {0, 1, 2, . . . , p −1} and the set {0, a, 2a, . . . , (p −1)a} form a complete residue system modulo p. Removing 0 from each set, we have that the sets {1, 2, . . . , p−1} and {a, 2a, . . . , (p−1)a} represent the same set of residues modulo p, possibly in a different order.

Modular Arithmetic Recall: For m ∈Z+ and a, b ∈Z, we say that a is congruent to b modulo m, denoted a ≡b (mod m), if and only if m | (a−b). We proved in\n\n**Proof:** We proceed by induction on the integer r ≥2. • Base case: r = 2. Let a1, a2 ∈Z and m1, m2 ∈Z+ with gcd(m1, m2) = 1. Consider the system of congruences x ≡a1 (mod m1) x ≡a2 (mod m2) Let x ∈Z satisfy x ≡a1 (mod m1). This is equivalent to the existence of some integer y1 such that x = m1y1 + a1. Fix y1. We now seek conditions on x that ensure x ≡a2 (mod m2). Since gcd(m1, m2) = 1, there exists n1 ∈Z such that m1n1 ≡1 (mod m2) by the MIRP Theorem (29.1.8). Fix such an n1. We then have the following logical equivalences: x ≡a2 (mod m2) ⇔m1y1 + a1 ≡a2 (mod m2) ⇔m1y1 ≡a2 −a1 (mod m2) ⇔y1 ≡n1(a2 −a1) (mod m2) ⇔y1 = n1(a2 −a1) + m2y2 for some y2 ∈Z ⇔x = m1n1(a2 −a1) + m1m2y2 + a1 for some y2 ∈Z ⇔x ≡m1n1(a2 −a1) + a1 (mod m1m2) Thus, x = m1n1(a2 −a1) + a1 is a solution to the system of congruences, and any solution must be congruent to this expression modulo m1m2. Therefore, the system of congruences has a unique solution modulo m1m2, as required. 195\n\n It is worth checking that x = m1n1(a2−a1)+a1 actually solves this system. When working modulo m1, we have x = m1n1(a2 −a1) + a1 ≡0 + a1 ≡a1 (mod m1) Working modulo m2, using m1n1 ≡1 (mod m2), we have x = m1n1(a2 −a1) + a1 ≡1 · (a2 −a1) + a1 ≡a2 (mod m2) • Inductive step: Let r ≥2 and assume the Chinese Remainder Theorem holds for any system of r congruences with pairwise relatively prime moduli. Let a1, . . . , ar, ar+1 ∈ Z and m1, . . . , mr, mr+1 ∈Z+ with the mi’s pairwise relatively prime. Consider the following system of (r + 1) congruences: x ≡a1 (mod m1) ... x ≡ar (mod mr) x ≡ar+1 (mod mr+1) By the inductive hypothesis, there exists a unique solution s ∈Z to the first r congruences modulo Qr i=1 mi. Our system now reduces to x ≡s (mod r Y i=1 mi) x ≡ar+1 (mod mr+1) Since gcd (Qr i=1 mi, mr+1) = 1, the moduli in this reduced system are relatively prime. By the base case, there is a unique solution modulo M = Qr+1 i=1 mi, completing the proof. By the Principle of Mathematical Induction, the Chinese Remainder Theorem holds for any integer r ≥2. Example 31.1.13. Find all integers x which satisfy the following system of congruences: x ≡1 (mod 2) x ≡2 (mod 3) x ≡3 (mod 5) By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there is a unique solution modulo 30 = 2 · 3 · 5. Suppose x is a solution to the system. We start with the largest modulus and work down to find x up to congruence modulo 30. 196\n\n • Since x ≡3 (mod 5), we have x = 5k + 3 for some k ∈Z. • Since x ≡2 (mod 3), we substitute to get 5k + 3 ≡2 (mod 3), which implies 2k ≡2 (mod 3). Thus, k ≡1 (mod 3), so k = 3ℓ+ 1 for some ℓ∈Z. Plugging this in, we get x = 5(3ℓ+ 1) + 3 = 15ℓ+ 8. • Since x ≡1 (mod 2), we substitute to get 15ℓ+ 8 ≡1 (mod 2), so x = 30m + 23 for m ∈Z. Thus, x ≡23 (mod 30) is the unique solution modulo 30. Example 31.1.14. Find all x ∈Z such that x2 ≡1 (mod 21). Solution. Since 21 = 3 · 7 and gcd(3, 7) = 1, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. The original congruence is equivalent to the system of congruences: x2 ≡1 (mod 3) and x2 ≡1 (mod 7) For any prime p, Euclid’s lemma implies the following: x2 ≡1 (mod p) ⇐⇒p | (x−1)(x+1) ⇐⇒p | (x−1)∨p | x+1 ⇐⇒x ≡±1 (mod p) Therefore, x2 ≡1 (mod 3) iff x ≡±1 (mod 3), and x2 ≡1 (mod 7) iff x ≡±1 (mod 7). We now have 4 independent systems to solve. For each one, the Chinese Remainder Theorem guarantees a unique solution modulo 21. • Case 1: x ≡1 (mod 3) and x ≡1 (mod 7). Then x ≡1 (mod 21) is a solution to this system, so must be unique modulo 21. • Case 2: x ≡−1 (mod 3) and x ≡−1 (mod 7). Then x ≡−1 ≡20 (mod 21) is a solution to this system, so must be unique modulo 21. • Case 3: x ≡1 (mod 3) and x ≡−1 (mod 7). Let x = 7k −1 for some k ∈Z. Substituting into the other congruence, we have: 7k −1 ≡1 (mod 3) =⇒k ≡2 (mod 3) so k = 3ℓ+ 2 for some ℓ∈Z. Thus, x = 7k −1 = 7(3ℓ+ 2) −1 = 21ℓ+ 13 Hence, x ≡13 (mod 21). • Case 4: x ≡−1 (mod 3) and x ≡1 (mod 7). Let x = 7k + 1 for some k ∈Z. Substitute into the other congruence to get: 7k + 1 ≡−1 (mod 3) =⇒k ≡−2 ≡1 (mod 3) so k = 3ℓ+ 1 for some ℓ∈Z. Thus, x = 7k + 1 = 7(3ℓ+ 1) + 1 = 21ℓ+ 8 Hence, x ≡8 (mod 21). 197\n\n Therefore, the set of all integers x satisfying x2 ≡1 (mod 21) is: {x ∈Z | x ≡±1 or ± 8 (mod 21)} Exercise 31.1.15. For each part below, find all solutions to the given system of congruences. (a) x ≡5 (mod 7) x ≡3 (mod 8) x ≡1 (mod 9) (b) 2x ≡1 (mod 23) 9x ≡12 (mod 31) (c) 3x + 1 ≡2 (mod 11) x ≡3 (mod 17) 5x ≡12 (mod 18) Exercise 31.1.16. Three roommates Adam, Bill, and Carol eat pizza on a regular basis. Adam eats pizza once every 3 days, Bill eats pizza once every 5 days, and Carol eats pizza once every 7 days. In 2025, Adam ate pizza on January 1, Bill ate pizza on January 2, and Carol ate pizza on January 3. What was the first date in 2025 that they all ate pizza on the same day? 31.1.3. Linear Diophantine Equations with Modular Arithmetic Recall Theorem 27.1.3. Theorem 31.1.17. Let a, b, c ∈Z with a and b not both zero. If gcd(a, b) | c, then there are infinitely many integer solutions to ax + by = c. Moreover, if (x0, y0) is one solution, then all solutions are given by {(x0 + m(b/d), y0 −m(a/d)) | m ∈Z, d = gcd(a, b)}. Memorizing formulas can be tedious. Now that we have a grasp of modular arithmetic, we can solve linear Diophantine equations without relying on memorization. This approach is demonstrated in the example below. Example 31.1.18. Find all integer solutions to the equation 9x + 15y = 6. Solution: Let x ∈Z be arbitrary. Then, ∃y ∈Z such that 9x + 15y = 6 ⇔9x ≡6 (mod 15) ⇔3x ≡2 (mod 5) ⇔x ≡4 (mod 5) ⇔∃k ∈Z such that x = 4 + 5k. 198\n\n So we have x = 4 + 5k for some k ∈Z. Fix any such k. Let y ∈Z satisfy 9x + 15y = 6, substitute x = 4 + 5k into the equation, and solve for y: 9(4 + 5k) + 15y = 6 ⇔15y = −30 −45k ⇔y = −2 −3k. Thus, the solution set to this Diophantine equation is {(4 + 5k, −2 −3k) | k ∈Z}. Exercise 31.1.19. Use modular arithmetic to find all solutions to the following linear Diophantiune equations. (a) 15x + 24y = 57 (b) 63x + 17y = 5 31.2. End Exam 3 Material 199\n\n Part VI. Combinatorics 200\n\n 32. November 14 32.1. Introduction Combinatorics, often called enumerative combinatorics in its simplest form, is the study of counting finite sets. While counting might sound straightforward, answering questions such as “How many elements have property X?” can quickly become complex and requires precise techniques. Historically, combinatorics originated in recreational mathematics and games-for example, in questions like “In how many ways can one deal a full house in poker?” Today, however, it is a foundational area of mathematics with applications across pure and applied mathematics, computer science, the natural sciences, and the social sciences. Its principles are especially useful in computer science for algorithm analysis and optimization, and in probability theory for computing event likelihoods. Combinatorics provides tools not only for counting and arranging objects but also for analyzing the structure and relationships among sets. The field has evolved to include a wide range of methods, from elementary counting techniques to more advanced approaches involving algebra and geometry, leading to insights across many areas of study. 32.2. Basic Counting Principles We begin by formalizing a few basic counting principles that may feel intuitive but are essential for a rigorous approach to combinatorics. Although these properties may seem obvious, stating them precisely will establish a foundation for more advanced counting techniques. 32.2.1. The Rule of Sum (Addition Principle) To state this theorem, we first define a slightly relaxed notion of a partition for finite sets (specific to combinatorics) that allows parts to be empty. 201", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}
{"instruction": "Prove that For all a, b ∈Z+, we have ab = gcd(a, b) · lcm[a, b]. Exercise 28.1.7. (a) Prove that a positive integer n is a perfect square if and only if the exponent of each prime factor of n is even. (b) Prove that if a and b are coprime positive integers and their product is a perfect square, then a and b are themselves perfect squares. (c) Prove that if a and b are positive integers and ab is a perfect square, then a = dm2 and b = dn2 where d = gcd(a, b), for some coprime integers m and n. (d) Reprove the irrationality of √ 2 in the following way: • Assume for the sake of contradiction that √ 2 = a b where a, b ∈Z+ are coprime. Use part (a) to arrive at a contradiction. Exercise 28.1.8. Use the fundamental theorem of arithmetic to prove that 171/3 is irrational. 28.2. Modular Arithmetic Recall: For m ∈Z+ and a, b ∈Z, we say that a is congruent to b modulo m, denoted a ≡b (mod m), if and only if m | (a−b). We proved in", "input": "", "output": "We proceed by induction on the integer r ≥2. • Base case: r = 2. Let a1, a2 ∈Z and m1, m2 ∈Z+ with gcd(m1, m2) = 1. Consider the system of congruences x ≡a1 (mod m1) x ≡a2 (mod m2) Let x ∈Z satisfy x ≡a1 (mod m1). This is equivalent to the existence of some integer y1 such that x = m1y1 + a1. Fix y1. We now seek conditions on x that ensure x ≡a2 (mod m2). Since gcd(m1, m2) = 1, there exists n1 ∈Z such that m1n1 ≡1 (mod m2) by the MIRP Theorem (29.1.8). Fix such an n1. We then have the following logical equivalences: x ≡a2 (mod m2) ⇔m1y1 + a1 ≡a2 (mod m2) ⇔m1y1 ≡a2 −a1 (mod m2) ⇔y1 ≡n1(a2 −a1) (mod m2) ⇔y1 = n1(a2 −a1) + m2y2 for some y2 ∈Z ⇔x = m1n1(a2 −a1) + m1m2y2 + a1 for some y2 ∈Z ⇔x ≡m1n1(a2 −a1) + a1 (mod m1m2) Thus, x = m1n1(a2 −a1) + a1 is a solution to the system of congruences, and any solution must be congruent to this expression modulo m1m2. Therefore, the system of congruences has a unique solution modulo m1m2, as required. 195\n\n It is worth checking that x = m1n1(a2−a1)+a1 actually solves this system. When working modulo m1, we have x = m1n1(a2 −a1) + a1 ≡0 + a1 ≡a1 (mod m1) Working modulo m2, using m1n1 ≡1 (mod m2), we have x = m1n1(a2 −a1) + a1 ≡1 · (a2 −a1) + a1 ≡a2 (mod m2) • Inductive step: Let r ≥2 and assume the Chinese Remainder Theorem holds for any system of r congruences with pairwise relatively prime moduli. Let a1, . . . , ar, ar+1 ∈ Z and m1, . . . , mr, mr+1 ∈Z+ with the mi’s pairwise relatively prime. Consider the following system of (r + 1) congruences: x ≡a1 (mod m1) ... x ≡ar (mod mr) x ≡ar+1 (mod mr+1) By the inductive hypothesis, there exists a unique solution s ∈Z to the first r congruences modulo Qr i=1 mi. Our system now reduces to x ≡s (mod r Y i=1 mi) x ≡ar+1 (mod mr+1) Since gcd (Qr i=1 mi, mr+1) = 1, the moduli in this reduced system are relatively prime. By the base case, there is a unique solution modulo M = Qr+1 i=1 mi, completing the proof. By the Principle of Mathematical Induction, the Chinese Remainder Theorem holds for any integer r ≥2. Example 31.1.13. Find all integers x which satisfy the following system of congruences: x ≡1 (mod 2) x ≡2 (mod 3) x ≡3 (mod 5) By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there is a unique solution modulo 30 = 2 · 3 · 5. Suppose x is a solution to the system.

Thus, k ≡1 (mod 3), so k = 3ℓ+ 1 for some ℓ∈Z. Plugging this in, we get x = 5(3ℓ+ 1) + 3 = 15ℓ+ 8. • Since x ≡1 (mod 2), we substitute to get 15ℓ+ 8 ≡1 (mod 2), so x = 30m + 23 for m ∈Z. Thus, x ≡23 (mod 30) is the unique solution modulo 30. Example 31.1.14. Find all x ∈Z such that x2 ≡1 (mod 21). Solution. Since 21 = 3 · 7 and gcd(3, 7) = 1, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

Substituting into the other congruence, we have: 7k −1 ≡1 (mod 3) =⇒k ≡2 (mod 3) so k = 3ℓ+ 2 for some ℓ∈Z. Thus, x = 7k −1 = 7(3ℓ+ 2) −1 = 21ℓ+ 13 Hence, x ≡13 (mod 21). • Case 4: x ≡−1 (mod 3) and x ≡1 (mod 7). Let x = 7k + 1 for some k ∈Z.

The Rule of Product (Multiplication Principle) Theorem 32.2.6 (Rule of Product). Let n ∈Z+ and let Ai be a finite set for each i ∈[n]. If A = A1 × A2 × · · · × An, then |A|= n Y i=1 |Ai|. This principle is intuitive, as illustrated by the following example. Example 32.2.7. Let A be the set of all possible meals that can be ordered at a restaurant where each meal consists of one appetizer, one entr´ee, and one dessert. Define A1 = the set of possible appetizers, A2 = the set of possible entr´ees, A3 = the set of possible desserts. 203\n\n We can view A as A = A1 × A2 × A3. If |A1|= 5, |A2|= 10, and |A3|= 6, then by the Rule of Product, |A|= 5 · 10 · 6 = 300. To formally prove this theorem, we can rely on results already discussed in the section on cardinality. Sketch of Proof. If Ai = ∅for any i, then |A|= 0 and Qn i=1|Ai|= 0. Otherwise, assume each Ai is nonempty and proceed by induction on n ∈Z+. The base case n = 1 is trivial, and for n = 2, we have shown that if |A1|= k and |A2|= ℓ, then |A1 ×A2|= kℓ. The general inductive step follows in a similar manner. The following restatement aligns more closely with how the Rule of Product is applied in practice. Theorem 32.2.8 (Rule of Product, Reformulated). Suppose that the elements of a set are constructed by making a sequence of k choices such that: (i) The i-th choice can be made in ri ways, independently of previous choices. (ii) Each element in the set is uniquely determined by this sequence of choices. Then the total number of elements in the set is given by Qk i=1 ri. Returning to our restaurant example, each possible meal results from a sequence of three independent choices: there are 5 choices for an appetizer, 10 choices for an entr´ee (regardless of the appetizer), and 6 choices for a dessert (regardless of prior selections). Thus, there are 5·10·6 = 300 possible meals, each uniquely determined by one sequence of choices. A Combined Example Using Rules of Sum and Product Example 32.2.9. How many strings of lowercase English letters are there of length 4 or less (including the empty string)? Let A be the set of all such strings. We can partition A by length: {A0, A1, A2, A3, A4}, where A0 = the set of strings of length 0, A1 = the set of strings of length 1, A2 = the set of strings of length 2, A3 = the set of strings of length 3, A4 = the set of strings of length 4. 204\n\n By the Rule of Sum, |A|= |A0|+|A1|+|A2|+|A3|+|A4|. Let S be the set of lowercase English letters, so |S|= 26. Applying the Rule of Product, we find |A0| = 1, |A1| = 26, |A2| = 262, |A3| = 263, |A4| = 264. Therefore, |A|= 1 + 26 + 262 + 263 + 264 = 475,255. A Combined Example Using Rules of Product and Division Example 32.2.10. How many 2-card hands can be dealt from a standard deck of 52 playing cards? Solution. Consider the following 2-step process for constructing a 2-card hand: • Select the first card from the deck: 52 choices. • Select the second card from the remaining 51 cards: 51 choices. By the Rule of Product, there are 52·51 ways to select an ordered pair of cards. However, the order of the cards in a hand does not matter, so each unordered 2-card hand is counted twice in this process. By the Rule of Division, we divide by 2 to account for this overcounting, yielding 52 · 51 2 = 1, 326 distinct 2-card hands. We will revisit similar counting problems when we discuss binomial coefficients. Exercise 32.2.11. A student is choosing a two-course meal from a menu that has 4 appetizers, 6 main courses, and 3 desserts. How many meals are possible if the student can choose to have: (a) An appetizer and a main course? (b) A main course and a dessert? 205\n\n (c) An appetizer and a dessert? (d) Any two distinct courses? (Meaning: an appetizer and a main, OR a main and a dessert, OR an appetizer and a dessert). Exercise 32.2.12. A car model comes in 4 colors, with 3 interior options, and 2 transmission types. Additionally, there is an optional sunroof that can be added only if the car is either red or blue. How many distinct car configurations are possible? Exercise 32.2.13. How many even 4-digit numbers are there with distinct digits? Exercise 32.2.14.

The Pigeonhole Principle Recall that we introduced the Pigeonhole Principle (Theorem 6.1.2) informally earlier in the semester. Below is a more formal statement, along with a proof. Theorem 32.2.16 (Pigeonhole Principle). Let A be a finite set partitioned into parts A1, . . . , Ak for some k ∈Z+. If |A|= n, then there exists i ∈[k] such that |Ai|≥ ln k m . In particular, if n > k, then there exists i ∈[k] such that |Ai|> 1. “If many pigeons are placed into too few pigeonholes, at least one pigeonhole will contain multiple pigeons.” Proof. Let A be partitioned into the sets {A1, . . . , Ak}. Assume, for contradiction, that |Ai|< n k for each i ∈[k]. Then, by the Rule of Sum, |A|= k X i=1 |Ai|< k X i=1 n k = n, which contradicts the assumption that |A|= n. Therefore, there must exist some i ∈[k] such that |Ai|≥ \u0006 n k \u0007 . 206", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

By the Rule of Division, we divide by 2 to account for this overcounting, yielding 52 · 51 2 = 1, 326 distinct 2-card hands. We will revisit similar counting problems when we discuss binomial coefficients. Exercise 32.2.11. A student is choosing a two-course meal from a menu that has 4 appetizers, 6 main courses, and 3 desserts. How many meals are possible if the student can choose to have: (a) An appetizer and a main course? (b) A main course and a dessert? 205\n\n (c) An appetizer and a dessert? (d) Any two distinct courses? (Meaning: an appetizer and a main, OR a main and a dessert, OR an appetizer and a dessert). Exercise 32.2.12.

How many binary strings of length 8 start with 1 or end with 00? 32.2.3. The Pigeonhole Principle Recall that we introduced the Pigeonhole Principle (Theorem 6.1.2) informally earlier in the semester. Below is a more formal statement, along with a proof. Theorem 32.2.16 (Pigeonhole Principle). Let A be a finite set partitioned into parts A1, . . . , Ak for some k ∈Z+. If |A|= n, then there exists i ∈[k] such that |Ai|≥ ln k m . In particular, if n > k, then there exists i ∈[k] such that |Ai|> 1. “If many pigeons are placed into too few pigeonholes, at least one pigeonhole will contain multiple pigeons.” Proof. Let A be partitioned into the sets {A1, . . . , Ak}. Assume, for contradiction, that |Ai|< n k for each i ∈[k]. Then, by the Rule of Sum, |A|= k X i=1 |Ai|< k X i=1 n k = n, which contradicts the assumption that |A|= n. Therefore, there must exist some i ∈[k] such that |Ai|≥ \u0006 n k \u0007 . 206", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

The Principle of Double Counting If we count the size of a set in two different ways, then both expressions for the cardinality of the set must be equal. This principle, known as double counting, often reveals interesting combinatorial identities. Example 33.1.1 (The Handshake Lemma). Suppose there are n people at a party, and everyone shakes hands with everyone else exactly once. How many handshakes occur in total? • Method 1: Each of the n people shakes hands with n −1 others. Counting all handshakes in this way gives n(n −1), but each handshake is counted twice (once for each participant). Thus, we divide by 2 to obtain the total number of unique handshakes: n(n −1) 2 . • Method 2: Number the n people from 1 to n. To avoid double counting, consider only the handshakes each person makes with those numbered lower than themselves. Let Ai denote the set of handshakes made by person i with people numbered below i. Since person i has i −1 such handshakes, we find |A|= n X i=1 |Ai|= n X i=1 (i −1) = n−1 X j=1 j. Since both expressions describe the total number of handshakes, they must be equal. Therefore, n(n −1) 2 = n−1 X j=1 j. This equality coincides with the formula for the sum of the first n −1 positive integers, which we previously proved by induction. The argument above illustrates a counting in two ways proof. We will encounter additional examples of this technique throughout the remainder of these notes. 209\n\n We now wish to discuss some additional combinatorial methods. Most counting problems that we encounter fall into one of four categories: arrangements without repetition, arrangements with repetition, selections without repetition, and selections with repetition. 33.2. Arrangements and Selections 33.2.1. Ordered Arrangements/Permutations Definition. Let n, k ∈N with n ≥k, and let X be a set with |X|= n. A karrangement of X is an injection f : [k] →X. Arrangements appear frequently in combinatorics, and several equivalent descriptions are used in practice. For example, a string of distinct letters is an arrangement: the positions in the string form the domain, and the chosen letters form the codomain. M A T H is a 4-arrangement of the alphabet (a string of length 4 with no repeated letters). Similarly, a finite sequence or ordered n-tuple with no repeated entries is an arrangement. The 5-tuple (1, 2, 3, 5, 8) is a 5-arrangement. Counting the number of k-arrangements of a set of size n is a straightforward application of the Rule of Product. Theorem 33.2.1. Let n, k ∈Z+ with n ≥k, and let X be a set with |X|= n. Then the number of k-arrangements from X is given by n · (n −1) · · · (n −k + 1) = k−1 Y i=0 (n −i) = n! (n −k)!. Proof. Without loss of generality, we may assume X = [n]. Let P(n, k) denote the set of k-arrangements of [n]. We construct an arbitrary f ∈P(n, k) through the following k-step procedure: • Choose f(1): there are n options. • Choose f(2), distinct from f(1): there are n −1 options. • In general, at step i, there are n −(i −1) options for f(i). 210\n\n After step k, the function f is completely determined. Each arrangement is produced by exactly one such sequence of choices, so by the Rule of Product, |P(n, k)|= k Y i=1 (n −(i −1)) = k−1 Y i=0 (n −i) = n! (n −k)!. We illustrate with a simple example. Example 33.2.2. Out of a group of 20 contestants, we must select first, second, and third place. How many possible outcomes are there? Let X be the set of contestants. This is equivalent to counting the number of injections f : [3] ,→X, since the three places must be assigned to three distinct contestants. Alternatively, we can view this as filling three ordered positions: 1st 2nd 3rd By the Rule of Product, there are 20 choices for 1st, 19 choices for 2nd, 18 choices for 3rd. 20 1st 19 2nd 18 3rd Thus the total number of possible outcomes is 20 · 19 · 18 = 20! 17! = 6840 . The most important special case is when k = n, which yields the notion of a permutation. Definition. Let n ∈Z+ and let X be a finite set with |X|= n. A permutation of X is a bijection f : [n] →X. Equivalently, a permutation is a string or ordered n-tuple containing each element of X exactly once. Notation: Given a set X, we denote the set of permutations of X by Sym(X).

The Rational Numbers Q is used to denote the “set of all rational numbers”. That is Q = na b | a, b ∈Z and b ̸= 0 o On a number line, Q represents the set of points obtained by dividing any unit segment into an equal number of parts. For example, dividing each unit into 3 equal parts gives a subset of the rational numbers, as illustrated below. Recall that addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of rational numbers are defined in terms of addition and multiplication of integers: a b + c d = ad + bc bd and a b · c d = ac bd 17\n\n Thus, many properties of the rational numbers can be derived from our assumed properties of the integers. Proposition 3.1.5. The following properties hold for rational numbers: 1. The sum (or difference) of two rational numbers is a rational number. 2. The product of two rational numbers is a rational number. 3. The quotient of two rational numbers, where the divisor is nonzero, is a rational number. We will prove property 1 below. The other properties follow similarly and are left as exercises for the reader.\n\n**Proof:** Let P(n, k) be the set of all k-arrangements from [n]. We count |P(n, k)| in two different ways. 1. By our previous result, we know that |P(n, k)|= n! (n−k)!. 2. Alternatively, we can build a k-arrangement in two steps: • First choose the underlying k elements. There are \u0000n k \u0001 ways to choose a ksubset of [n]. • Then arrange these k elements in order, which can be done in k! ways. By the Rule of Product, we conclude that |P(n, k)|= k! \u0000n k \u0001 . Equating the two expressions for |P(n, k)| gives n! (n −k)! = k! \u0012n k \u0013 . Solving for \u0000n k \u0001 completes the proof: \u0012n k \u0013 = n! k! (n −k)!. Corollary 33.2.8. For n, k ∈N with 0 ≤k ≤n, \u0012n k \u0013 = \u0012 n n −k \u0013 . Example 33.2.9.

Counting Arguments Before developing more theory, we will pause to look at some examples that apply the counting principles we have established so far. 34.1.1. Poker Hands A common example in introductory combinatorics or discrete probability is counting poker hands. We will use a standard deck of 52 playing cards (4 suits, each with 13 ranks), but no prior knowledge of poker is required; any poker-specific details will be provided as needed. Example 34.1.1. How many 5-card poker hands are One Pair hands? A One Pair hand consists of 2 cards of one rank and 3 additional cards, each of distinct ranks different from the pair and different from one another (so the hand is neither a three-of-a-kind nor a two-pair). We can use a multi-step Rule of Product approach to ensure that each one-pair hand is constructed in exactly one way and that no invalid hands are counted. Rule of Product procedure: • Choose the rank of the pair: \u000013 1 \u0001 = 13 choices. • From that rank, choose 2 suits: \u00004 2 \u0001 choices. • Choose 3 additional ranks (all distinct and all different from the paired rank): \u000012 3 \u0001 choices. • For each of these 3 ranks, choose a suit: \u00004 1 \u00013 = 43 choices. By the Rule of Product, the total number of one-pair hands is: Total = \u001213 1 \u0013 · \u00124 2 \u0013 · \u001212 3 \u0013 · 43 = 1, 098, 240 Answer: 1,098,240 one-pair hands. 216\n\n If you used a different Rule-of-Product approach, that is perfectly fine. The final count will be the same, though there are several valid ways to construct the set. Here is one alternative method: Alternative procedure: • Select 4 distinct ranks to appear in the hand: \u000013 4 \u0001 choices. • From these 4 ranks, choose 1 to be the rank of the pair: \u00004 1 \u0001 choices. • For this rank, choose 2 suits: \u00004 2 \u0001 choices. • For each of the 3 remaining ranks, choose a suit: \u00004 1 \u00013 = 43 choices. Applying the Rule of Product again yields Total = \u001213 4 \u0013 · \u00124 1 \u0013 · \u00124 2 \u0013 · 43 = 1, 098, 240 Answer: 1,098,240 one-pair hands. Let us try another example involving poker hands. Example 34.1.2. A 5-card poker hand is called a Full House if it consists of 3 cards of one rank and 2 cards of another rank (that is, a three-of-a-kind together with a pair). How many distinct Full House hands are possible? Rule of Product procedure: • Choose the two ranks that will appear in the hand: \u000013 2 \u0001 choices. • From these two ranks, choose the rank of the three-of-a-kind: \u00002 1 \u0001 = 2 choices. • For that rank, choose 3 suits: \u00004 3 \u0001 choices. • For the remaining rank, choose 2 suits: \u00004 2 \u0001 choices. Thus, by the Rule of Product, the number of Full House hands is Total = \u001213 2 \u0013 · \u00122 1 \u0013 · \u00124 3 \u0013 · \u00124 2 \u0013 = 3,744. Answer: 3,744 Full House hands. Exercise 34.1.3. A Three-of-a-Kind is a 5-card hand that contains 3 cards of one rank, with the remaining 2 cards each of different ranks, distinct from the three-of-a-kind and from each other (that is, not a Full House and not a Four-of-a-Kind). How many distinct Three-of-a-Kind hands are possible? 217\n\n 34.1.2. Binary n-tuples A common example in combinatorics involves counting subsets of binary n-tuples. Many combinatorial arguments can be phrased in terms of binary n-tuples (as you may have seen in recitation). We will find these useful for our discussion of selections with repetition. Example 34.1.4. For n ∈Z+, recall that {0, 1}n denotes the set of binary n-tuples. Let n ≥3. How many binary n-tuples are there that contain at least three 1’s? In many counting problems, it is easier to determine the size of the complement of a set rather than counting the set directly. Here, instead of counting all binary n-tuples with exactly three 1’s, four 1’s, . . . , up to n 1’s, it is simpler to count the number with zero, one, or two 1’s and subtract this from the total number of binary n-tuples. Define S = {0, 1}n. First, note that |S|= 2n since each component has two choices, 0 or 1. We now calculate the number of binary n-tuples with fewer than three 1’s. For each i ∈{0, 1, 2}, let Ai denote the subset of binary n-tuples that contain exactly i many 1’s. • |A0|= \u0000n 0 \u0001 = 1, because a binary n-tuple with no 1’s must be the tuple (0, 0, . . . , 0). • |A1|= \u0000n 1 \u0001 = n. Here we choose which one of the n components is 1; all remaining components are 0. • |A2|= \u0000n 2 \u0001 = n(n−1) 2 . We select two of the n components to be 1’s; all remaining components are 0. Since the sets A0, A1, A2 are pairwise disjoint, the Rule of Difference gives |S \\ (A0 ∪A1 ∪A2)|= 2n − \u0012n 0 \u0013 − \u0012n 1 \u0013 − \u0012n 2 \u0013 Thus, there are 2n − \u0000n 0 \u0001 − \u0000n 1 \u0001 − \u0000n 2 \u0001 binary n-tuples with at least three 1’s. Later, when we introduce the Principle of Inclusion–Exclusion, we will see how to handle complements when the relevant sets are not disjoint. This example motivates the following proposition. Proposition 34.1.5. For all n ∈N, 2n = nP i=0 \u0000n i \u0001 . Below we present another example of a counting in two ways argument, using the Principle of Double Counting. 218\n\n Proof. Let n ∈N, and consider the set S = {0, 1}n of binary n-tuples. If n = 0, the only element of S is the empty string, so |S|= 20 = 1. For n ≥1, |S|= 2n by the arrangements-with-repetition formula, since each of the n components has two choices. Alternatively, we can count |S| by partitioning S as {Si | 0 ≤i ≤n}, where Si is the set of binary n-tuples with exactly i components equal to 1. Observe that if i ̸= j, then Si ∩Sj = ∅, because no binary n-tuple can have both i and j components equal to 1. Furthermore, n[ i=0 Si = S, since every binary n-tuple has between 0 and n entries equal to 1. Thus, {Si | 0 ≤i ≤n} is a partition of S. For each i ∈{0, 1, . . . , n}, we have |Si|= \u0000n i \u0001 , since forming such a tuple amounts to choosing which i of the n components are 1’s. Using the Rule of Sum, |S|= n X i=0 |Si|= n X i=0 \u0012n i \u0013 . Equating the two expressions for |S| yields 2n = n X i=0 \u0012n i \u0013 . Exercise 34.1.6. Let n ∈Z+ and S be the set of all binary strings of length n. Each of the following expressions is the size of some subset of S. For each one, identify such a subset and explain why it works.

Counting in Two Ways Proofs We have now seen several examples of proofs using the principle of double counting. This proof technique has several advantages. First, it is sometimes difficult to establish an equality algebraically, while a combinatorial proof may be far more transparent. Second, even when an identity can be proved algebraically or by induction, those methods may obscure the underlying combinatorial idea. Counting in two ways often reveals why the equality is true by highlighting the processes being counted. Below is a basic template for a “counting in two ways” proof. Counting in Two Ways Proof Template 1. Motivated by the expressions on both sides of the equation, define a set S whose cardinality you will compute in two ways. Make sure the definition of your set is clear. 2. Give a counting argument for |S| that yields the expression on the left-hand side of the equation. 3. Give a counting argument for |S| that yields the expression on the right-hand side of the equation. 4. Conclude that since both expressions count |S|, they must be equal. We now look at some standard examples of counting in two ways. 35.1.1. Pascal’s Triangle Many high school algebra courses introduce Pascal’s triangle as a tool for expanding binomials. If you have seen it before, you may recall that the entries on the sides are 1’s, and each entry inside the triangle is the sum of the two entries directly above it. Rows 0 through 5 are shown below. Although this is Pascal’s triangle, we can formally define it using binomial coefficients. Each entry is equal to \u0000n k \u0001 , where n is the row number and k is the position within the row. Both n and k start at 0, with 0 ≤k ≤n. 221\n\n n = 0: 1 n = 1: 1 1 n = 2: 1 2 1 n = 3: 1 3 3 1 n = 4: 1 4 6 4 1 n = 5: 1 5 10 10 5 1 Table 35.1.: Pascal’s Triangle Using this notation, Pascal’s triangle may be rewritten as in Table 35.2. \u00120 0 \u0013 \u00121 0 \u0013 \u00121 1 \u0013 \u00122 0 \u0013 \u00122 1 \u0013 \u00122 2 \u0013 \u00123 0 \u0013 \u00123 1 \u0013 \u00123 2 \u0013 \u00123 3 \u0013 \u00124 0 \u0013 \u00124 1 \u0013 \u00124 2 \u0013 \u00124 3 \u0013 \u00124 4 \u0013 \u00125 0 \u0013 \u00125 1 \u0013 \u00125 2 \u0013 \u00125 3 \u0013 \u00125 4 \u0013 \u00125 5 \u0013 Table 35.2.: Pascal’s Triangle We now show that this binomial coefficient description is equivalent to the recursive version in Table 35.1. In particular, we prove the following. Theorem 35.1.1 (Pascal’s Formula). For all n, k ∈Z+ with k ≤n, it holds that \u0000n k \u0001 = \u0000n−1 k \u0001 + \u0000n−1 k−1 \u0001 . This identity states that each binomial coefficient equals the sum of the two entries directly above it. We prove it using a counting in two ways argument. Proof. Motivated by the left-hand side, define S = {T ∈P([n]) | |T|= k}, the set of all k-element subsets of [n]. We compute |S| in two ways. 222\n\n • Left-hand side (LHS): By definition, |S|= \u0000n k \u0001 , since \u0000n k \u0001 represents the number of k-element subsets of a set with n-many elements. • Right-hand side (RHS): We partition S into subsets A and B defined as follows: A = {T ∈S | 1 ∈T}, B = {T ∈S | 1 /∈T}. Notice that S = A ∪B and A ∩B = ∅, so {A, B} forms a partition of S. We count |A| and |B| separately: ▶|A|= \u0000n−1 k−1 \u0001 , since each subset in A includes the element 1, leaving k −1 elements to be chosen from the remaining n −1 elements. ▶|B|= \u0000n−1 k \u0001 , since each subset in B is formed by choosing all k-elements from the set {2, 3, . . . , n}. By the Rule of Sum, we have |S|= |A|+|B|= \u0012n −1 k −1 \u0013 + \u0012n −1 k \u0013 . Equating our two expressions for |S| yields \u0000n k \u0001 = \u0000n−1 k−1 \u0001 + \u0000n−1 k \u0001 . There are many interesting patterns in Pascal’s triangle. For example, consider what happens when we sum the entries along a diagonal. 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 3 3 1 1 4 6 4 1 1 5 10 10 5 1 1 6 15 20 15 6 1 Table 35.3.: Summation Identity Summing the red entries along the diagonal produces the boxed red entry one row below and one position to the right. The same holds for the blue diagonal. This pattern persists throughout Pascal’s triangle. We now generalize this observation. 223\n\n Proposition 35.1.2 (Summation Identity). For all k, n ∈N, we have: n X i=0 \u0012i k \u0013 = \u0012n + 1 k + 1 \u0013 . Proof. Let k, n ∈N, and let S = {T ∈P([n + 1]) | |T|= k + 1}. We will compute |S| in two different ways. • Right-hand side: By definition, |S|= \u0000n+1 k+1 \u0001 . • Left-hand side: Partition S into subsets Si for i ∈[n] ∪{0} where Si = {T ∈S | (i + 1 ∈T) ∧∀j ∈T, j ≤i + 1}. Here, Si consists of all subsets T ∈S where the largest element is i + 1. Clearly, Si ∩Sj = ∅for i ̸= j, and since any T ∈S has a largest element between 1 and n + 1, we have Sn i=0 Si = S. Thus, {Si} is indeed a partition of S. For each 0 ≤i ≤n, |Si|= \u0000i k \u0001 , since there are \u0000i k \u0001 ways to select the remaining k elements of a subset of size k + 1 with i + 1 as the largest element. By the Rule of Sum, |S|= Pn i=0|Si|= Pn i=0 \u0000i k \u0001 . Therefore, \u0000n+1 k+1 \u0001 = Pn i=0 \u0000i k \u0001 . 35.1.2. The Binomial Theorem Before moving on to more examples of counting in two ways arguments, we record an important identity involving binomial coefficients. You will prove this theorem in recitation, but we state it here for later reference. Theorem 35.1.3 (Binomial Theorem). For all n ∈N and all real numbers x, y, we have (x + y)n = n X k=0 \u0012n k \u0013 x n−ky k. The coefficients in this expansion are exactly the entries that appear in Pascal’s triangle. In fact, if you list the coefficients of (x + y)n in order, you obtain the entire nth row of the triangle. This connection is one of the main reasons binomial coefficients play such a central role in counting. 224", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}
{"instruction": "Prove that For any n ∈Z: • n is even if and only if n = 2m for some m ∈Z. • n is odd if and only if n = 2m + 1 for some m ∈Z. Exercise 3.1.3.

The Rational Numbers Q is used to denote the “set of all rational numbers”. That is Q = na b | a, b ∈Z and b ̸= 0 o On a number line, Q represents the set of points obtained by dividing any unit segment into an equal number of parts. For example, dividing each unit into 3 equal parts gives a subset of the rational numbers, as illustrated below. Recall that addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of rational numbers are defined in terms of addition and multiplication of integers: a b + c d = ad + bc bd and a b · c d = ac bd 17\n\n Thus, many properties of the rational numbers can be derived from our assumed properties of the integers. Proposition 3.1.5. The following properties hold for rational numbers: 1. The sum (or difference) of two rational numbers is a rational number. 2. The product of two rational numbers is a rational number. 3. The quotient of two rational numbers, where the divisor is nonzero, is a rational number. We will prove property 1 below. The other properties follow similarly and are left as exercises for the reader.", "input": "", "output": "Let P(n, k) be the set of all k-arrangements from [n]. We count |P(n, k)| in two different ways. 1. By our previous result, we know that |P(n, k)|= n! (n−k)!. 2. Alternatively, we can build a k-arrangement in two steps: • First choose the underlying k elements. There are \u0000n k \u0001 ways to choose a ksubset of [n]. • Then arrange these k elements in order, which can be done in k! ways. By the Rule of Product, we conclude that |P(n, k)|= k! \u0000n k \u0001 . Equating the two expressions for |P(n, k)| gives n! (n −k)! = k! \u0012n k \u0013 .

Counting Arguments Before developing more theory, we will pause to look at some examples that apply the counting principles we have established so far. 34.1.1. Poker Hands A common example in introductory combinatorics or discrete probability is counting poker hands. We will use a standard deck of 52 playing cards (4 suits, each with 13 ranks), but no prior knowledge of poker is required; any poker-specific details will be provided as needed. Example 34.1.1. How many 5-card poker hands are One Pair hands? A One Pair hand consists of 2 cards of one rank and 3 additional cards, each of distinct ranks different from the pair and different from one another (so the hand is neither a three-of-a-kind nor a two-pair). We can use a multi-step Rule of Product approach to ensure that each one-pair hand is constructed in exactly one way and that no invalid hands are counted. Rule of Product procedure: • Choose the rank of the pair: \u000013 1 \u0001 = 13 choices. • From that rank, choose 2 suits: \u00004 2 \u0001 choices. • Choose 3 additional ranks (all distinct and all different from the paired rank): \u000012 3 \u0001 choices. • For each of these 3 ranks, choose a suit: \u00004 1 \u00013 = 43 choices. By the Rule of Product, the total number of one-pair hands is: Total = \u001213 1 \u0013 · \u00124 2 \u0013 · \u001212 3 \u0013 · 43 = 1, 098, 240 Answer: 1,098,240 one-pair hands. 216\n\n If you used a different Rule-of-Product approach, that is perfectly fine. The final count will be the same, though there are several valid ways to construct the set. Here is one alternative method: Alternative procedure: • Select 4 distinct ranks to appear in the hand: \u000013 4 \u0001 choices. • From these 4 ranks, choose 1 to be the rank of the pair: \u00004 1 \u0001 choices. • For this rank, choose 2 suits: \u00004 2 \u0001 choices. • For each of the 3 remaining ranks, choose a suit: \u00004 1 \u00013 = 43 choices. Applying the Rule of Product again yields Total = \u001213 4 \u0013 · \u00124 1 \u0013 · \u00124 2 \u0013 · 43 = 1, 098, 240 Answer: 1,098,240 one-pair hands. Let us try another example involving poker hands. Example 34.1.2. A 5-card poker hand is called a Full House if it consists of 3 cards of one rank and 2 cards of another rank (that is, a three-of-a-kind together with a pair). How many distinct Full House hands are possible? Rule of Product procedure: • Choose the two ranks that will appear in the hand: \u000013 2 \u0001 choices. • From these two ranks, choose the rank of the three-of-a-kind: \u00002 1 \u0001 = 2 choices. • For that rank, choose 3 suits: \u00004 3 \u0001 choices. • For the remaining rank, choose 2 suits: \u00004 2 \u0001 choices. Thus, by the Rule of Product, the number of Full House hands is Total = \u001213 2 \u0013 · \u00122 1 \u0013 · \u00124 3 \u0013 · \u00124 2 \u0013 = 3,744. Answer: 3,744 Full House hands. Exercise 34.1.3. A Three-of-a-Kind is a 5-card hand that contains 3 cards of one rank, with the remaining 2 cards each of different ranks, distinct from the three-of-a-kind and from each other (that is, not a Full House and not a Four-of-a-Kind). How many distinct Three-of-a-Kind hands are possible? 217\n\n 34.1.2. Binary n-tuples A common example in combinatorics involves counting subsets of binary n-tuples. Many combinatorial arguments can be phrased in terms of binary n-tuples (as you may have seen in recitation). We will find these useful for our discussion of selections with repetition. Example 34.1.4. For n ∈Z+, recall that {0, 1}n denotes the set of binary n-tuples. Let n ≥3. How many binary n-tuples are there that contain at least three 1’s? In many counting problems, it is easier to determine the size of the complement of a set rather than counting the set directly. Here, instead of counting all binary n-tuples with exactly three 1’s, four 1’s, . . . , up to n 1’s, it is simpler to count the number with zero, one, or two 1’s and subtract this from the total number of binary n-tuples. Define S = {0, 1}n. First, note that |S|= 2n since each component has two choices, 0 or 1. We now calculate the number of binary n-tuples with fewer than three 1’s. For each i ∈{0, 1, 2}, let Ai denote the subset of binary n-tuples that contain exactly i many 1’s. • |A0|= \u0000n 0 \u0001 = 1, because a binary n-tuple with no 1’s must be the tuple (0, 0, . . . , 0). • |A1|= \u0000n 1 \u0001 = n. Here we choose which one of the n components is 1; all remaining components are 0. • |A2|= \u0000n 2 \u0001 = n(n−1) 2 . We select two of the n components to be 1’s; all remaining components are 0. Since the sets A0, A1, A2 are pairwise disjoint, the Rule of Difference gives |S \\ (A0 ∪A1 ∪A2)|= 2n − \u0012n 0 \u0013 − \u0012n 1 \u0013 − \u0012n 2 \u0013 Thus, there are 2n − \u0000n 0 \u0001 − \u0000n 1 \u0001 − \u0000n 2 \u0001 binary n-tuples with at least three 1’s. Later, when we introduce the Principle of Inclusion–Exclusion, we will see how to handle complements when the relevant sets are not disjoint. This example motivates the following proposition. Proposition 34.1.5. For all n ∈N, 2n = nP i=0 \u0000n i \u0001 . Below we present another example of a counting in two ways argument, using the Principle of Double Counting. 218\n\n Proof. Let n ∈N, and consider the set S = {0, 1}n of binary n-tuples. If n = 0, the only element of S is the empty string, so |S|= 20 = 1. For n ≥1, |S|= 2n by the arrangements-with-repetition formula, since each of the n components has two choices. Alternatively, we can count |S| by partitioning S as {Si | 0 ≤i ≤n}, where Si is the set of binary n-tuples with exactly i components equal to 1. Observe that if i ̸= j, then Si ∩Sj = ∅, because no binary n-tuple can have both i and j components equal to 1. Furthermore, n[ i=0 Si = S, since every binary n-tuple has between 0 and n entries equal to 1. Thus, {Si | 0 ≤i ≤n} is a partition of S. For each i ∈{0, 1, . . . , n}, we have |Si|= \u0000n i \u0001 , since forming such a tuple amounts to choosing which i of the n components are 1’s. Using the Rule of Sum, |S|= n X i=0 |Si|= n X i=0 \u0012n i \u0013 . Equating the two expressions for |S| yields 2n = n X i=0 \u0012n i \u0013 . Exercise 34.1.6. Let n ∈Z+ and S be the set of all binary strings of length n. Each of the following expressions is the size of some subset of S. For each one, identify such a subset and explain why it works. (a) 2n−2 (b) 2n − \u0000n n \u0001 − \u0000 n n−1 \u0001 − \u0000 n n−2 \u0001 − \u0000 n n−3 \u0001 (c) \u0000n 2 \u0001 − \u0000n−1 1 \u0001 (d) ⌊n/2⌋ P k=0 \u0000n k \u0001 Exercise 34.1.7. Consider finding the number of 4-tuples from the set {1, 2, 3} that include one of each number. In both parts (a) and (b) a student proposes a “Proof” for the number of such 4-tuples. Explain why their reasoning is incorrect by exhibiting an object in the set that has been counted twice. 219\n\n (a) Pick one of the 4 spots in the tuple for the 1, then pick a spot for the 2, then pick a spot for the 3. Then pick one of the three numbers to appear in the 4th empty spot. \u00124 1 \u0013\u00123 1 \u0013\u00122 1 \u0013\u00123 1 \u0013 = 72 (b) Pick 3 of the 4 spots to be filled by the numbers 1,2,3. Permute those elements in those chosen spots. Pick a number for the 4th empty spot. \u00124 3 \u0013 · 3! ·3 = 72 (c) Provide a correct counting argument for the number of possible 4-tuples. 220\n\n 35. November 24 35.1. Counting in Two Ways Proofs We have now seen several examples of proofs using the principle of double counting. This proof technique has several advantages. First, it is sometimes difficult to establish an equality algebraically, while a combinatorial proof may be far more transparent. Second, even when an identity can be proved algebraically or by induction, those methods may obscure the underlying combinatorial idea. Counting in two ways often reveals why the equality is true by highlighting the processes being counted. Below is a basic template for a “counting in two ways” proof. Counting in Two Ways Proof Template 1. Motivated by the expressions on both sides of the equation, define a set S whose cardinality you will compute in two ways. Make sure the definition of your set is clear. 2. Give a counting argument for |S| that yields the expression on the left-hand side of the equation. 3. Give a counting argument for |S| that yields the expression on the right-hand side of the equation. 4. Conclude that since both expressions count |S|, they must be equal. We now look at some standard examples of counting in two ways. 35.1.1. Pascal’s Triangle Many high school algebra courses introduce Pascal’s triangle as a tool for expanding binomials. If you have seen it before, you may recall that the entries on the sides are 1’s, and each entry inside the triangle is the sum of the two entries directly above it. Rows 0 through 5 are shown below. Although this is Pascal’s triangle, we can formally define it using binomial coefficients. Each entry is equal to \u0000n k \u0001 , where n is the row number and k is the position within the row. Both n and k start at 0, with 0 ≤k ≤n. 221\n\n n = 0: 1 n = 1: 1 1 n = 2: 1 2 1 n = 3: 1 3 3 1 n = 4: 1 4 6 4 1 n = 5: 1 5 10 10 5 1 Table 35.1.: Pascal’s Triangle Using this notation, Pascal’s triangle may be rewritten as in Table 35.2. \u00120 0 \u0013 \u00121 0 \u0013 \u00121 1 \u0013 \u00122 0 \u0013 \u00122 1 \u0013 \u00122 2 \u0013 \u00123 0 \u0013 \u00123 1 \u0013 \u00123 2 \u0013 \u00123 3 \u0013 \u00124 0 \u0013 \u00124 1 \u0013 \u00124 2 \u0013 \u00124 3 \u0013 \u00124 4 \u0013 \u00125 0 \u0013 \u00125 1 \u0013 \u00125 2 \u0013 \u00125 3 \u0013 \u00125 4 \u0013 \u00125 5 \u0013 Table 35.2.: Pascal’s Triangle We now show that this binomial coefficient description is equivalent to the recursive version in Table 35.1. In particular, we prove the following. Theorem 35.1.1 (Pascal’s Formula). For all n, k ∈Z+ with k ≤n, it holds that \u0000n k \u0001 = \u0000n−1 k \u0001 + \u0000n−1 k−1 \u0001 . This identity states that each binomial coefficient equals the sum of the two entries directly above it. We prove it using a counting in two ways argument. Proof. Motivated by the left-hand side, define S = {T ∈P([n]) | |T|= k}, the set of all k-element subsets of [n]. We compute |S| in two ways. 222\n\n • Left-hand side (LHS): By definition, |S|= \u0000n k \u0001 , since \u0000n k \u0001 represents the number of k-element subsets of a set with n-many elements. • Right-hand side (RHS): We partition S into subsets A and B defined as follows: A = {T ∈S | 1 ∈T}, B = {T ∈S | 1 /∈T}. Notice that S = A ∪B and A ∩B = ∅, so {A, B} forms a partition of S. We count |A| and |B| separately: ▶|A|= \u0000n−1 k−1 \u0001 , since each subset in A includes the element 1, leaving k −1 elements to be chosen from the remaining n −1 elements. ▶|B|= \u0000n−1 k \u0001 , since each subset in B is formed by choosing all k-elements from the set {2, 3, . . . , n}. By the Rule of Sum, we have |S|= |A|+|B|= \u0012n −1 k −1 \u0013 + \u0012n −1 k \u0013 . Equating our two expressions for |S| yields \u0000n k \u0001 = \u0000n−1 k−1 \u0001 + \u0000n−1 k \u0001 . There are many interesting patterns in Pascal’s triangle. For example, consider what happens when we sum the entries along a diagonal. 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 3 3 1 1 4 6 4 1 1 5 10 10 5 1 1 6 15 20 15 6 1 Table 35.3.: Summation Identity Summing the red entries along the diagonal produces the boxed red entry one row below and one position to the right. The same holds for the blue diagonal. This pattern persists throughout Pascal’s triangle. We now generalize this observation. 223\n\n Proposition 35.1.2 (Summation Identity). For all k, n ∈N, we have: n X i=0 \u0012i k \u0013 = \u0012n + 1 k + 1 \u0013 . Proof. Let k, n ∈N, and let S = {T ∈P([n + 1]) | |T|= k + 1}. We will compute |S| in two different ways. • Right-hand side: By definition, |S|= \u0000n+1 k+1 \u0001 . • Left-hand side: Partition S into subsets Si for i ∈[n] ∪{0} where Si = {T ∈S | (i + 1 ∈T) ∧∀j ∈T, j ≤i + 1}. Here, Si consists of all subsets T ∈S where the largest element is i + 1. Clearly, Si ∩Sj = ∅for i ̸= j, and since any T ∈S has a largest element between 1 and n + 1, we have Sn i=0 Si = S. Thus, {Si} is indeed a partition of S. For each 0 ≤i ≤n, |Si|= \u0000i k \u0001 , since there are \u0000i k \u0001 ways to select the remaining k elements of a subset of size k + 1 with i + 1 as the largest element. By the Rule of Sum, |S|= Pn i=0|Si|= Pn i=0 \u0000i k \u0001 . Therefore, \u0000n+1 k+1 \u0001 = Pn i=0 \u0000i k \u0001 . 35.1.2. The Binomial Theorem Before moving on to more examples of counting in two ways arguments, we record an important identity involving binomial coefficients. You will prove this theorem in recitation, but we state it here for later reference. Theorem 35.1.3 (Binomial Theorem). For all n ∈N and all real numbers x, y, we have (x + y)n = n X k=0 \u0012n k \u0013 x n−ky k. The coefficients in this expansion are exactly the entries that appear in Pascal’s triangle. In fact, if you list the coefficients of (x + y)n in order, you obtain the entire nth row of the triangle. This connection is one of the main reasons binomial coefficients play such a central role in counting. 224", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

For all k, n ∈N, we have: n X i=0 \u0012i k \u0013 = \u0012n + 1 k + 1 \u0013 .\n\n**Proof:** Let k, n ∈Z+, and let S be the set of all k-person committees with a designated chairperson, formed from a group of n people. We will compute |S| in two different ways. • (LHS): Construct an element of S by the following procedure: ▶Choose a k-person committee from the n people. There are \u0000n k \u0001 ways to do this. ▶From the k committee members, select one person to serve as chair. There are k choices. By the Rule of Product, |S|= k \u0000n k \u0001 . • (RHS): Alternatively, construct an element of S as follows: ▶Choose the chairperson from among the n people.

Therefore, k \u0012n k \u0013 = n \u0012n −1 k −1 \u0013 . Remark. The set S used in the proof above can also be described formally as S = {(T, t) ∈P([n]) × [n] : t ∈T, |T|= k}. Here, [n] represents the set of n people, T represents the committee, and t is the designated chairperson (a distinguished element of T). While this formal description is precise, describing the elements of S as “committees with leaders” often makes the combinatorial structure more transparent. The next exercise continues this idea with a small twist. Try to solve it on your own before reading further. 226\n\n Exercise 35.1.7. Let n ∈Z+. Prove that n · 2n−1 = n X k=1 k \u0012n k \u0013 . 227\n\n 36. December 1 36.1. Counting in Two Ways Proofs We now modify the previous example to explore another useful counting argument. The twist here is that we must keep track of two roles on each committee, and an important distinction will arise. Example 36.1.1. Prove that for all n ∈Z+, n X k=1 k2 \u0012n k \u0013 = n · 2n−1 + n(n −1) · 2n−2. Proof. Let n ∈Z+, and let S be the set of all nonempty committees formed from n people, where each committee has both a leader and a planner. The leader and planner may be the same person or two different people. Important note. When describing a set such as S, we must specify whether the two roles must be filled by distinct individuals. The counting changes significantly depending on whether overlap is allowed. A precise description of S is: S = {(T, k, ℓ) ∈P([n]) × [n] × [n] : k ∈T, ℓ∈T}, where T is the committee, k is the leader, and ℓis the planner. We now count |S| in two ways. • (LHS): Counting by committee size. Partition S into the subsets Sk, where Sk consists of committees of size k.

Partition S into two subsets: A = committees where the leader and planner are the same person, B = committees where the leader and planner are distinct people. Counting A: ▶Choose the person who serves as both leader and planner: n choices. ▶Choose any (possibly empty) subset of the remaining n−1 people to complete the committee: 2 n−1 choices. By the rule of product, |A|= n · 2n−1. Counting B: ▶Choose the leader: n choices. ▶Choose the planner from the remaining n −1 people: n −1 choices. ▶From the remaining n−2 people, choose a (possibly empty) subset to complete the committee: 2 n−2 choices. By the rule of product, |B|= n(n −1) · 2n−2. By the Rule of Sum, |S|= |A|+|B|= n · 2n−1 + n(n −1) · 2n−2.

Selections with Repetition In this section, we address the question: With repetition allowed, how many ways are there to select n objects from k types of objects? To build intuition, we first examine a concrete example. Example 36.2.1. A donut shop sells 10 different flavors of donuts. You want to buy 12 donuts from the shop. How many distinct ways can you order these dozen donuts? This is a selection problem because the order in which the donuts are chosen does not matter. For example, selecting a glazed donut followed by a powdered donut is the same as selecting a powdered donut followed by a glazed donut. However, this is not a simple selection problem because choosing 2 glazed donuts is different from choosing 1 glazed donut in your box of 12. To visualize the situation, imagine organizing the 12 donuts by flavor: OO OOO · · · · · · · · · O Flavor 1 Flavor 2 · · · · · · · · · Flavor 10 Place an O above Flavor n (for 1 ≤n ≤10) for each donut of that flavor. To separate the flavors, insert dividers between groups. In total, the diagram contains 12 O’s (one for each donut) and 9 dividers (one fewer than the number of flavors). This arrangement corresponds to a binary string of length 12+10−1 = 21, consisting of 12 0’s (donuts) and 9 1’s (dividers). The number of possible arrangements is the number of ways to choose 12 positions for the 0’s (or equivalently, 9 positions for the 1’s): \u001221 12 \u0013 = \u001221 9 \u0013 = 293, 930. Thus, there are 293,930 distinct ways to buy a dozen donuts. This correspondence between selections with repetition and binary strings leads directly to the following general theorem. 230", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

We will prove the existence portion later, when we study induction. For now, we prove the uniqueness portion. Uniqueness. Let q1, q2, r1, r2 ∈Z satisfy a = bq1 + r1 = bq2 + r2, 0 ≤r1 < b, 0 ≤r2 < b. From the inequalities, we obtain −b < −r2 ≤0. Adding this to 0 ≤r1 < b gives −b < r1 −r2 < b. Since bq1 + r1 = bq2 + r2, it follows that r1 −r2 = b(q2 −q1). Thus r1 −r2 is a multiple of b. Dividing the inequality −b < r1 −r2 < b by b yields −1 < q2 −q1 < 1. Because q2 −q1 ∈Z, we must have q2 −q1 = 0, so q1 = q2. Substituting back gives r1 −r2 = b(q2 −q1) = 0, hence r1 = r2.

(b) Write the logical negation of this statement in maximally negated form. (c) Prove the original statement. 7.1.3. Proof-Writing Tips Writing Proofs • State Your Hypotheses. Clearly state any assumptions or conditions needed for your proof. For example, if you assume that a function is continuous or that a set is non-empty, make sure to state this explicitly at the beginning of the proof. 47\n\n • Check Your Proof’s Structure. Ensure that your proof has a clear structure with a defined start, body, and conclusion. The proof should lead logically from the hypotheses to the conclusion, and each part of the proof should contribute to this progression. • Include All Steps. Don’t skip steps when writing your proofs. It is important for your reader to follow your work. Even if a step seems obvious to you, include it. Your intended audience should be able to completely understand and verify your proof. • Explain Why Steps Are Valid. Each step should be correct and clearly justified. If a step relies on a theorem or lemma, briefly mention this and explain why the application is valid. • Define New Variables or Notation. When introducing new variables or notation, be clear. For example, instead of writing “Since n is even, n = 2m,” write “Since n is even, there exists an integer m such that n = 2m.” • Use First Person Plural. Proofs should be written in the first person plural using the pronoun “we.” For instance, “We then have. . . ” or “We now see that. . . ” • Use Complete Sentences. Good mathematical writing uses complete sentences. Your proof should be a short work of mathematical prose, with correct grammar, sentence structure, and punctuation. Students writing proofs for the first time often feel like they’re not allowed to use words because they’re “not math.” A page full of just a series of mathematical symbols might look impressive, but it usually makes your argument harder to follow. Words (and even diagrams) are often necessary to explain your arguments. Notation should be used in moderation to improve readability and precision. • Indicate Directions in Biconditional Proofs. When proving biconditional claims, clearly indicate which direction of the proposition you are proving. For instance, if you are proving P ↔Q, your proof should have two parts: (⇒): Prove P →Q (⇐): Prove Q →P • Use Appropriate Notation. Use the appropriate notation for the context. For example, instead of writing “Let a ∈X,” it is better to write “Let x ∈X” or “Let a ∈A.” Avoid confusing notations like “Let X ∈A × B.” Instead, write “Let (a, b) ∈A × B.” • Revise and Refine. After completing a proof, review it to check for clarity and accuracy. Look for any parts that might be confusing or ambiguous and revise them. Rewriting parts of the proof in simpler terms can also help clarify your arguments. 48\n\n Coming Up With Proofs • Determine Hypotheses. Identify your hypotheses clearly. The proposition is likely not true without these hypotheses. • Clarify the Goal. Determine exactly what you are trying to show. • Use Scratch Work. The order in which we come up with a proof is often not the order in which we write it. Do some scratch work first. Work both forward from the assumptions and backward from the desired conclusion. Ideally, find a place in between where they meet. • Look for Similar Proofs. Consider how the proof of the proposition may be similar to previous proofs you have seen. Look through example problems from the text, lecture notes, unassigned problems, or worksheets. Are there ideas from any of these proofs that you can apply to your current problem? • Check Definitions. When stuck, review your definitions. For instance, if you have assumed that 5 | n, how can you rewrite n from the definition of divisibility? • Use Concrete", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

For b /∈Im(f), map b to an arbitrary fixed a0 ∈A. This covers all a ∈A since g(f(a)) = a. (⇐): Suppose f : B →A is surjective. Then for each a ∈A, PreImf({a}) is nonempty.

This represents the smallest size of an infinite set, making it a natural starting point for exploring results about the sizes of infinite sets, which often defy intuition. For instance, we have already shown that there exists a bijection f : N →2N. This implies that |2N|= |N|, even though 2N ⊊N. In other words, there are just as many natural numbers as there are even natural numbers. We have also previously encountered bijections g : N →Z and h : N →N2.

From the inequalities, we obtain −b < −r2 ≤0. Adding this to 0 ≤r1 < b gives −b < r1 −r2 < b. Since bq1 + r1 = bq2 + r2, it follows that r1 −r2 = b(q2 −q1). Thus r1 −r2 is a multiple of b. Dividing the inequality −b < r1 −r2 < b by b yields −1 < q2 −q1 < 1. Because q2 −q1 ∈Z, we must have q2 −q1 = 0, so q1 = q2. Substituting back gives r1 −r2 = b(q2 −q1) = 0, hence r1 = r2.

Clearly state any assumptions or conditions needed for your proof. For example, if you assume that a function is continuous or that a set is non-empty, make sure to state this explicitly at the beginning of the proof. 47\n\n • Check Your Proof’s Structure. Ensure that your proof has a clear structure with a defined start, body, and conclusion. The proof should lead logically from the hypotheses to the conclusion, and each part of the proof should contribute to this progression. • Include All Steps. Don’t skip steps when writing your proofs. It is important for your reader to follow your work. Even if a step seems obvious to you, include it. Your intended audience should be able to completely understand and verify your proof. • Explain Why Steps Are Valid. Each step should be correct and clearly justified. If a step relies on a theorem or lemma, briefly mention this and explain why the application is valid. • Define New Variables or Notation. When introducing new variables or notation, be clear. For example, instead of writing “Since n is even, n = 2m,” write “Since n is even, there exists an integer m such that n = 2m.” • Use First Person Plural. Proofs should be written in the first person plural using the pronoun “we.” For instance, “We then have. . . ” or “We now see that. . . ” • Use Complete Sentences. Good mathematical writing uses complete sentences. Your proof should be a short work of mathematical prose, with correct grammar, sentence structure, and punctuation. Students writing proofs for the first time often feel like they’re not allowed to use words because they’re “not math.” A page full of just a series of mathematical symbols might look impressive, but it usually makes your argument harder to follow. Words (and even diagrams) are often necessary to explain your arguments. Notation should be used in moderation to improve readability and precision. • Indicate Directions in Biconditional Proofs. When proving biconditional claims, clearly indicate which direction of the proposition you are proving. For instance, if you are proving P ↔Q, your proof should have two parts: (⇒): Prove P →Q (⇐): Prove Q →P • Use Appropriate Notation. Use the appropriate notation for the context. For example, instead of writing “Let a ∈X,” it is better to write “Let x ∈X” or “Let a ∈A.” Avoid confusing notations like “Let X ∈A × B.” Instead, write “Let (a, b) ∈A × B.” • Revise and Refine. After completing a proof, review it to check for clarity and accuracy. Look for any parts that might be confusing or ambiguous and revise them. Rewriting parts of the proof in simpler terms can also help clarify your arguments. 48\n\n Coming Up With Proofs • Determine Hypotheses. Identify your hypotheses clearly. The proposition is likely not true without these hypotheses. • Clarify the Goal. Determine exactly what you are trying to show. • Use Scratch Work. The order in which we come up with a proof is often not the order in which we write it. Do some scratch work first. Work both forward from the assumptions and backward from the desired conclusion. Ideally, find a place in between where they meet. • Look for Similar Proofs. Consider how the proof of the proposition may be similar to previous proofs you have seen. Look through example problems from the text, lecture notes, unassigned problems, or worksheets. Are there ideas from any of these proofs that you can apply to your current problem? • Check Definitions. When stuck, review your definitions. For instance, if you have assumed that 5 | n, how can you rewrite n from the definition of divisibility? • Use Concrete", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

Well-Ordered Sets Proof by Infinite Descent The other major application of the Well-Ordering Property is a variant of induction known as a proof by infinite descent. One consequence of the Well-Ordering Property is that there is no infinite descending sequence of natural numbers. In a proof by infinite descent, we assume, for the sake of contradiction, that the claim fails for some n ∈N. We then show that it must also fail for a smaller value m ∈N. Iterating this process would yield an infinite descending sequence of natural numbers, contradicting the Well-Ordering Property.

This represents the smallest size of an infinite set, making it a natural starting point for exploring results about the sizes of infinite sets, which often defy intuition. For instance, we have already shown that there exists a bijection f : N →2N. This implies that |2N|= |N|, even though 2N ⊊N. In other words, there are just as many natural numbers as there are even natural numbers. We have also previously encountered bijections g : N →Z and h : N →N2. Thus, we can conclude that |2N|= |N|= |Z|= |N2|. Next, we will prove some important results about countable sets, beginning with a classic example.

Induction 67\n\n 10. September 17 10.1. Principle of Mathematical Induction Previously, we discussed proving universal statements by showing that a proposition holds for an arbitrary element of the set in question. However, for universal statements of the form For every integer n ≥M, P(n) is true, there is another technique known as the principle of mathematical induction that is often more effective. To introduce this principle, we first recall our working definition of N. This definition captures the essential structure of the natural numbers without going into the deeper foundations of set theory. Definition (Working Definition). The set of natural numbers N is the “smallest” set I such that 0 ∈I and (∀k ∈I, k + 1 ∈I). That is, let I be any set such that 0 ∈I and whenever k ∈I, then also k + 1 ∈I. Define F = {X ⊆I | 0 ∈X ∧∀k ∈I, (k ∈X →k + 1 ∈X)}. Then N = \\ X∈F X. Remark. Other, more formal approaches to defining the natural numbers exist. The Peano axioms characterize N through logical rules, while in set theory (ZFC) one can construct N explicitly from the axioms. We will not use these approaches in this course, but a brief sketch of the set-theoretic construction is provided in Appendix A. From this working definition of N, we immediately obtain the following result, which justifies the method of proof by induction. 68", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

Basic Cardinality Comparisons There are various cardinalities of infinite sets, some of which may appear different in size but actually have the same cardinality. To illustrate this phenomenon, mathematician David Hilbert proposed the famous thought experiment known as Hilbert’s Hotel. 21.3.1. Hilbert’s Hotel Imagine a hotel with infinitely many rooms, enumerated by the natural numbers: 136\n\n Suppose all the rooms at Hilbert’s Hotel are currently occupied. Let’s explore how the hotel can still accommodate additional guests under various scenarios. 1. Suppose 1 new guest arrives. Can we find them a room? Even though all rooms are occupied, we can still accommodate the new guest. Instruct each current guest in room n to move to room n + 1. This frees up room 0, which can now be given to the new guest. This scenario demonstrates that |N ∪{−1}|= |N|. 2. Suppose an infinite number of new guests arrive, enumerated by N. Can we find rooms for them? Despite all rooms being occupied and an infinite number of new guests arriving, it is still possible to find rooms for everyone. Move each current guest in room n to room 2n. This leaves all odd-numbered rooms vacant, which can be assigned to the new guests. Specifically, place new guest m in room 2m + 1. This scenario illustrates that |{0, 1} × N|= |N|. 3. Suppose an infinite number of buses (enumerated by N), each containing an infinite number of guests (also enumerated by N), arrive. Can we find rooms for them? This situation is more challenging, since we now have infinitely many groups of infinitely many guests arriving while all rooms are still occupied. Surprisingly, we can still accommodate everyone by utilizing the fact that there are infinitely many prime numbers, and that for distinct primes p and q and integers k and ℓ, pk ̸= qℓ. Here’s how we proceed: 137\n\n • Move the current guest in room n to room 2n+1. Now, only rooms of the form 2k (for some k ∈Z+) are occupied, leaving all other rooms vacant. • For bus 0, assign new guest n to room 3n+1. • For bus 1, assign new guest n to room 5n+1. • In general, for bus m, assign new guest n to room pn+1 m+2, where pm+2 denotes the (m + 2)-nd prime number. • At this point, every guest has a room, and some rooms remain empty (e.g., rooms 1 and 6). Any room not of the form pk for some prime p and positive integer k is vacant. This scenario shows that |N2|≤|N|, since the room assignment defines an injection rather than a bijection. Recall: We previously constructed a bijection f : N2 →N, confirming that |N2|= |N|. 138\n\n 22. October 24 22.1. Basic Cardinality Comparisons 22.1.1. Countable vs. Uncountable Sets The main distinction among infinite sets that we will discuss is whether they can be placed in bijective correspondence with N. Definitions. A set X is called: • countably infinite if there exists a bijection f : N →X. In this case, we denote its cardinality by |X|= ℵ0. • countable (also called listable or denumerable) if X is either finite or countably infinite. • uncountable if X is infinite but not countably infinite. Up to this point, every set we have encountered is countable. To justify the existence of uncountable sets, we first need to understand why ℵ0 represents the “smallest” infinite cardinality. To do this, we must establish two facts: 1. N is not finite, and 2. if X is an infinite set, then there exists an injection f : N →X. We begin by showing that N is infinite. Specifically, we will prove that there is no bijection f : [n] →N for any n ∈N. The key ingredient is the following lemma.", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

Since y > 0, the right-hand side must also be positive, which forces (x − 2)(x+2) < 0. This implies that (x−2) and (x+2) have opposite signs. Since x + 2 > x −2 it must be the case that x + 2 > 0 and x −2 < 0, which gives us that −2 < x < 2.

Proof. We will prove that f is both injective and surjective. • Injectivity: Let x1, x2 ∈R such that f(x1) = f(x2). We consider three cases: Case 1: Assume x1, x2 < 1. Then 1 x1 −1 = 1 x2 −1. Rearranging gives x1 −1 = x2 −1, so x1 = x2, as required. Case 2: Assume x1, x2 ≥1. Then √ x1 −1 = √ x2 −1. Squaring both sides yields x1 −1 = x2 −1, so x1 = x2. 103\n\n Case 3: Without loss of generality, assume x1 < 1 and x2 ≥1. Then f(x1) = 1 x1 −1 < 0, f(x2) = √ x2 −1 ≥0. Since a negative number cannot equal a nonnegative number, this contradicts the assumption that f(x1) = f(x2). Since all cases either forced x1 = x2 or led to a contradiction, we conclude that f is injective. • Surjectivity: Let y ∈R. We want to show there exists x ∈R such that f(x) = y. We split into two cases: Case 1: Suppose y < 0. Define x = 1 y + 1. Since y ̸= 0 and y < 0, it follows that x < 1. Then f(x) = f \u00121 y + 1 \u0013 = 1 1 y + 1 −1 = 1 1 y = y. Case 2: Suppose y ≥0. Define x = y2 + 1. Since y2 ≥0, we have x ≥1. Then f(x) = f(y2 + 1) = p y2 + 1 −1 = p y2 = |y|= y, where the last equality holds because y ≥0. In both cases, we have found an x ∈R such that f(x) = y. Therefore, f is surjective. Since f is both injective and surjective, we conclude that f is a bijection. Because f : R →R is a bijection, this is also visible in its graph: every horizontal line intersects the graph at exactly one point, confirming both injectivity and surjectivity.

We will show that g is the inverse of f. • Well-Definedness: Since x ̸= 1 for all x ∈T, the expression 3x −2 x −1 is defined. If x1 = x2, then clearly 3x1 −2 x1 −1 = 3x2 −2 x2 −1 , so g(x1) = g(x2).

We want to find an equivalence relation R on S such that S/R = F. Define R ⊆S × S by declaring two elements related if they belong to the same block of the partition. Explicitly, R = {(1, 1), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 2), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 2), (6, 5), (6, 6)}. We can manually check that R is an equivalence relation on S. • (R): Is (x, x) ∈R for each x ∈[6]? ✓ • (S): For each (x, y) ∈R, is (y, x) ∈R also? ✓ • (T): For each (x, y), (y, z) ∈R, is (x, z) ∈R also? ✓ So, R is an equivalence relation on S, and S/R has 3 distinct equivalence classes. [1]R = {1}, [2]R = [5]R = [6]R = {2, 5, 6}, [3]R = [4]R = {3, 4}. Thus, the set of equivalence classes is exactly the given partition: S/R = {[1]R, [2]R, [3]R} = F.

We want to show that R is an equivalence relation and that S/R = F. First, we check reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity. • (R): Let x ∈S. Since F is a partition of S, we have S i∈I Si = S. Hence, x ∈Si for some i ∈I, by the definition of an indexed union. Fix such an i. Then x ∈Si implies that (x, x) ∈R, as desired. • (S): Let x, y ∈S such that (x, y) ∈R. Then, by definition of R, we have x ∈ Si ∧y ∈Si for some i ∈I. Fix such an i. Since conjunction is commutative, this implies y ∈Si ∧x ∈Si. Hence (y, x) ∈R, as desired. • (T): Let x, y, z ∈S such that (x, y), (y, z) ∈R. Then, by definition of R, there exists i ∈I such that x ∈Si ∧y ∈Si, and there exists j ∈I such that y ∈Sj ∧z ∈Sj. Fix such i and j. Since F is a partition of S and y ∈Si and y ∈Sj, it must be the case that Si = Sj (the pieces of a partition are either equal or disjoint). Thus, x ∈Si ∧z ∈Si, implying that (x, z) ∈R, as desired. Therefore, R is an equivalence relation on S. It remains to show S/R = F. We proceed by double containment. • (⊆): Let A ∈S/R. Then, by definition, A = [x]R for some x ∈S. Since F is a partition, x belongs to exactly one block Si ∈F. Then A = [x]R = {y ∈S | y ∈Si} = Si. Therefore, A ∈F, as desired. • (⊇): Let Si ∈F. Since F is a partition, Si ̸= ∅. Fix x ∈Si. By uniqueness of the partition blocks, Si is the only block of F containing x. Thus [x]R = {y ∈S | y ∈Si} = Si, so Si ∈S/R. By double containment, we conclude that S/R = F.

Recognizing and applying these concepts will deepen your understanding of advanced mathematics and the connections between its different areas. 119\n\n 19.1.3. (Optional) Formal Constructions of Z and Q Previously, we discussed how to construct the natural numbers (or a structure having the same properties as N) from the axioms of set theory. Now, with the power of equivalence relations, we can formally construct the integers and rational numbers. This approach allows us to define addition and multiplication on these sets in a way that is consistent with the operations we already take for granted. Constructing the Integers The natural numbers do not include additive inverses, so subtraction is not always possible within N. To address this, we will construct the integers by introducing formal differences. The guiding idea is that an ordered pair (a, b) ∈N2 represents the “formal difference” a −b. However, we must be careful: since subtraction is not defined in N, we cannot simply say (a, b) = (c, d) whenever a −b = c −d. Instead, we use the following property of N: Cancellation Law: If k + m = n + m then k = n. This motivates the following definition.", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

Using our definition of addition, we could write: [(2, 0)]∼+ [(3, 0)]∼= [(2 + 3, 0 + 0)]∼= [(5, 0)]∼, which represents the number 5, as expected. But we could also represent 2 and 3 differently: [(3, 1)]∼+ [(10, 7)]∼= [(3 + 10, 1 + 7)]∼= [(13, 8)]∼, which also represents the number 5. Our theorem states that no matter which representatives of 2 and 3 we choose, the sum will always represent 5. Similarly, for the product 2 · 3 = 6: [(2, 0)]∼· [(3, 0)]∼= [(6 + 0, 0 + 0)]∼= [(6, 0)]∼ 121\n\n represents 6, while [(3, 1)]∼· [(10, 7)]∼= [(30 + 7, 21 + 10)]∼= [(37, 31)]∼ also represents 6. This illustrates that multiplication, too, should be independent of the choice of representatives. We now proceed to prove the theorem. Proof. Let (a, b), (a′, b′), (c, d), (c′, d′) ∈N2 such that (a, b) ∼(a′, b′) and (c, d) ∼(c′, d′). 1. We want to show that (a + c, b + d) ∼(a′ + c′, b′ + d′). By assumption, a + b′ = b + a′ and c + d′ = d + c′. Adding these two equalities gives a + c + b′ + d′ = b + d + a′ + c′, which shows (a + c, b + d) ∼(a′ + c′, b′ + d′). Thus, addition is well-defined on Z. 2. We want to show that (ac + bd, ad + bc) ∼(a′c′ + b′d′, a′d′ + b′c′). As in the previous case, from our assumptions we have a + b′ = b + a′ and c + d′ = d + c′. Multiplying the first equality by c and d, and the second by a′ and b′, we obtain c(a + b′) = c(b + a′), d(a + b′) = d(b + a′), and a′(c + d′) = a′(d + c′), b′(c + d′) = b′(d + c′). Adding these four equalities together yields c(a+b′)+d(a+b′)+a′(c+d′)+b′(c+d′) = c(b+a′)+d(b+a′)+a′(d+c′)+b′(d+c′). Expanding both sides gives ac+bd+a′d′ +b′c′ +b′c+a′d+a′c+b′d = ad+bc+a′c′ +b′d′ +a′c+b′d+a′d+b′c. Cancelling the common terms on both sides, we are left with ac + bd + a′d′ + b′c′ = ad + bc + a′c′ + b′d′. 122\n\n This is exactly the condition that (ac + bd, ad + bc) ∼(a′c′ + b′d′, a′d′ + b′c′), as desired. Therefore multiplication is well-defined on Z. Remark. With these definitions of addition and multiplication, the set Z inherits many of the familiar properties we expect integers to satisfy: associativity, commutativity, distributivity, and the existence of additive identities and inverses.

To visualize this mapping, consider its action on the first few natural numbers: 143\n\n x h(x) x h(x) 1 4 7 28 2 2 8 8 3 12 9 36 4 16 10 10 5 20 11 44 6 6 12 48 The table illustrates how h maps elements from N to 2N. You should verify for yourself that this mapping is indeed injective and surjective, confirming h as a bijection. Note, however, that while the CBS theorem ensures the existence of such a bijection, it does not necessarily yield the simplest one. A much simpler bijection is j : N →2N defined by j(x) = 2x, which is more direct but does not arise from the CBS theorem’s construction. Finally, our definition of ≥is motivated by the following theorem, which tells us that the existence of an injection one way is equivalent to the existence of a surjection the other way.

{"instruction": "Work through the following example step by step.", "input": "Example 24.1.5", "output": "To illustrate Cantor’s Theorem for the case S = N, we will show that no surjection f : N →P(N) can exist. Let f : N →P(N) be an arbitrary function, and define T = {n ∈N | n /∈f(n)}. We claim that T is not equal to f(n) for any n ∈N. To get some intuition, let us look at a few examples. • Suppose f(0) = {0, 3}. Then 0 /∈T because 0 ∈f(0), so T ̸= f(0). • Suppose f(1) = {5}. Then 1 ∈T because 1 /∈f(1), so T ̸= f(1). • Suppose f(2) = N. Then 2 /∈T because 2 ∈f(2), so T ̸= f(2). • Suppose f(3) = {1, 2, 4}. Then 3 ∈T because 3 /∈f(3), so T ̸= f(3). In each case, T differs from f(n) at the element n itself. More generally, for any n ∈N, we have two cases: 155\n\n ▶Case 1: If n ∈f(n), then n /∈T, so T ̸= f(n). ▶Case 2: If n /∈f(n), then n ∈T, so T ̸= f(n). Thus, for every n ∈N, the set T differs from f(n) in at least one element—specifically, at the “diagonal position” n. This pattern of constructing a new object that disagrees with the n-th object at the n-th coordinate is the essence of the diagonalization method. Since T ∈P(N) and T ̸= f(n) for all n ∈N, we conclude that f is not a surjection. Therefore, |N|< |P(N)|. Diagonalization thus provides a systematic way to construct an element not listed in any proposed enumeration. 24.1.3.

Suppose there are n people at a party, and everyone shakes hands with everyone else exactly once. How many handshakes occur in total? • Method 1: Each of the n people shakes hands with n −1 others. Counting all handshakes in this way gives n(n −1), but each handshake is counted twice (once for each participant). Thus, we divide by 2 to obtain the total number of unique handshakes: n(n −1) 2 . • Method 2: Number the n people from 1 to n. To avoid double counting, consider only the handshakes each person makes with those numbered lower than themselves. Let Ai denote the set of handshakes made by person i with people numbered below i. Since person i has i −1 such handshakes, we find |A|= n X i=1 |Ai|= n X i=1 (i −1) = n−1 X j=1 j. Since both expressions describe the total number of handshakes, they must be equal. Therefore, n(n −1) 2 = n−1 X j=1 j. This equality coincides with the formula for the sum of the first n −1 positive integers, which we previously proved by induction. The argument above illustrates a counting in two ways proof. We will encounter additional examples of this technique throughout the remainder of these notes. 209\n\n We now wish to discuss some additional combinatorial methods.

How many binary n-tuples are there that contain at least three 1’s? In many counting problems, it is easier to determine the size of the complement of a set rather than counting the set directly. Here, instead of counting all binary n-tuples with exactly three 1’s, four 1’s, . . . , up to n 1’s, it is simpler to count the number with zero, one, or two 1’s and subtract this from the total number of binary n-tuples. Define S = {0, 1}n. First, note that |S|= 2n since each component has two choices, 0 or 1. We now calculate the number of binary n-tuples with fewer than three 1’s. For each i ∈{0, 1, 2}, let Ai denote the subset of binary n-tuples that contain exactly i many 1’s. • |A0|= \u0000n 0 \u0001 = 1, because a binary n-tuple with no 1’s must be the tuple (0, 0, . . . , 0). • |A1|= \u0000n 1 \u0001 = n.

Later, when we introduce the Principle of Inclusion–Exclusion, we will see how to handle complements when the relevant sets are not disjoint. This example motivates the following proposition. Proposition 34.1.5. For all n ∈N, 2n = nP i=0 \u0000n i \u0001 . Below we present another example of a counting in two ways argument, using the Principle of Double Counting. 218\n\n Proof. Let n ∈N, and consider the set S = {0, 1}n of binary n-tuples. If n = 0, the only element of S is the empty string, so |S|= 20 = 1. For n ≥1, |S|= 2n by the arrangements-with-repetition formula, since each of the n components has two choices. Alternatively, we can count |S| by partitioning S as {Si | 0 ≤i ≤n}, where Si is the set of binary n-tuples with exactly i components equal to 1. Observe that if i ̸= j, then Si ∩Sj = ∅, because no binary n-tuple can have both i and j components equal to 1. Furthermore, n[ i=0 Si = S, since every binary n-tuple has between 0 and n entries equal to 1. Thus, {Si | 0 ≤i ≤n} is a partition of S. For each i ∈{0, 1, . . . , n}, we have |Si|= \u0000n i \u0001 , since forming such a tuple amounts to choosing which i of the n components are 1’s. Using the Rule of Sum, |S|= n X i=0 |Si|= n X i=0 \u0012n i \u0013 . Equating the two expressions for |S| yields 2n = n X i=0 \u0012n i \u0013 .", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

Similarly, for the triple intersection, we have: |A5 ∩A7 ∩A11| = \u0016 1000 lcm[5, 7, 11] \u0017 = \u00161000 385 \u0017 = 2. By the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion, we have: |A5 ∪A7 ∪A11|= |A5|+|A7|+|A11|−|A5 ∩A7|−|A5 ∩A11|−|A7 ∩A11|+|A5 ∩A7 ∩A11|, Substituting the values, we get: |A5 ∪A7 ∪A11| = 200 + 142 + 90 −28 −18 −12 + 2 = 376 . Thus, there are 376 integers from 1 to 1000 that are divisible by 5, 7, or 11. 238\n\n Often, the cardinality | T i∈X Ai| does not depend on the specific subsets Ai, but only on |X| – the number of subsets in the intersection. In such cases, the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion can be expressed in a simpler form. Corollary 37.2.3. Let m ∈N, S be a finite set, and A1, A2, . . . , Am ∈P(S). Further, assume that for each X ⊆[m], the cardinality | T i∈X Ai| depends only on |X|.

Note: • |Ai|= 95 for each i ∈{2, 5, 8}, as these are integers with 5 digits, excluding one specific digit (9 choices per digit). • |Ai ∩Aj|= 85 for all i ̸= j ∈{2, 5, 8}, since these are integers excluding two specific digits (8 choices per digit). • |A2 ∩A5 ∩A8|= 75, as these are integers excluding all three digits (7 choices per digit).

Basic Set Theory A set is a foundational concept in mathematics, and much of mathematics can be expressed in terms of set theory. In formal set theory, a set is treated as an undefined primitive, with its properties and behavior described by axioms. This level of rigor goes beyond the scope of this course. Instead, we will adopt a naive, intuitive understanding of sets that is sufficient for our purposes. Definition. A set is a well-defined collection of objects, considered as a single object in its own right. The objects in a set are called elements (or members). A set is well-defined if, given any object, we can unambiguously decide whether it belongs to the set. For example, we may define P as the set of all prime numbers, or S as the set of all students currently enrolled in 21-127. Notation. We commonly use capital letters to denote sets and lowercase letters to denote elements of sets. We write x ∈X to indicate that “x is an element of X,” and x /∈X to indicate that “x is not an element of X.” 2.1.1. How to Define a Set In mathematics, defining a set using a description, such as “Let P be the set of prime numbers,” can sometimes be acceptable for informal discussions. However, such definitions are often unclear or ambiguous and can lead to misunderstandings or inaccuracies. Precise and unambiguous definitions are crucial for rigorous mathematical reasoning and proofs. To avoid these issues, mathematicians use formal methods to define sets. Two common methods are roster notation and set-builder notation. Roster Notation Roster notation lists all the elements of a set explicitly. For example, the set of the first five prime numbers can be written as P = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11}. This method is straightforward 9\n\n but only practical for sets with a small number of elements. When dealing with sets that have a clear and recognizable pattern, we may sometimes use an informal “implied list” notation with ellipses, such as E = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, . . .} In these cases, it is important to include a clarifying setence to specify the pattern: “Here E represents the set of nonnegative, even integers.” Although this method is informal, it sometimes can be the easiest way to convey the idea to the reader. Set-Builder Notation Set-Builder Notation provides a more flexible and precise way to define sets, especially those with infinitely many elements. It describes the properties that characterize the elements of the set. For instance, we can define P(x) to be the predicate “x2 ≥8”. As we discussed before, this is not a proposition because x is not defined, but when a real number is substituted for x, it becomes a proposition. If P(x) is a predicate, then the set S of all elements x from a larger set A which satisfy P(x) is denoted as S = {x ∈A | P(x)} or S = {x ∈A : P(x)} On the left side of the vertical line (or colon), we indicate which set our elements are coming from, and on the right side of the vertical line, we indicate which properties must hold of them. Example 2.1.1. Let S be the set of students in 21-127. We may define a new set F as F = {x ∈S | x is a freshman} Then F is the set of all freshmen in 21-127. Example 2.1.2. Let R be the set of all real numbers. We may define a new set S as S = {x ∈R | x2 −x −2 > 0} This is the set of all real numbers satisfying the inequality x2 −x −2 > 0. 2.1.2. Set Equality and Subsets The defining characteristics of sets stem from the definition of set equality. 10\n\n Definition. Let A and B be sets. We say that A and B are equal, denoted A = B, iff the following two properties hold: 1. Every element from A is also an element of B. 2. Every element from B is also an element of A. Note. From the definition of set equality, we see that order, repetition, and set presentation do not matter when determining if two sets are the same. For example, if we define sets A, B, and C as A = {1, −1}, B = {1, −1, 1}, C = {x ∈R | x2 = 1} then A = B = C. Definition. We say a set A is a subset of a set B, denoted A ⊆B, iff every element of A is also an element of B. Note. We can now rephrase the definition of set equality in terms of subsets: A = B iff A ⊆B and B ⊆A The ⊆relation has a property known as transitivity, which we will discuss in more detail in the future. Below, we will see how transitivity is an immediate consequence of our formal definition above. Theorem 2.1.3 (Transitivity of the Subset Relation). For any sets A, B, and C, if A ⊆B and B ⊆C, then A ⊆C. (We will feel our way through our first proof.) Proof. Assume that A, B, and C are arbitrary sets with the property that A ⊆B and B ⊆C. Our goal is to show that A ⊆C. We start by taking an arbitrary element a ∈A. Since we are given that A ⊆B, by the definition of a subset, every element of A is also an element of B. Therefore, we have a ∈B. Next, we use the fact that B ⊆C. By the definition of a subset, every element of B is also an element of C. Since we have already established that a ∈B, it follows that a ∈C. Since a was chosen arbitrarily from A, this reasoning applies to all elements of A. Thus, every element of A is also an element of C, which means A ⊆C by definition of a subset. Therefore, we have shown that if A ⊆B and B ⊆C, then A ⊆C. 11\n\n Notation. · A ̸⊆B means “A is not a subset of B”. By our definition of a subset, this means that there exists an element a ∈A such that a /∈B. · A ⊊B or A ⊂B means “A is a proper subset of B”.

Number Sets Several sets of numbers are so commonly referred to that they get fixed notation. For now, several properties of these sets from elementary algebra will be taken for granted. The Natural Numbers N is used to denote the set of natural numbers. That is, N = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, . . .} N is defined to be the smallest set containing 0 and closed under the successor function (the +1 function). Informally, the natural numbers are the points on a number line that 12\n\n can be obtained by starting at 0 and moving right by a unit of length any number of times. (Our standard counting numbers.) Properties of N we may assume: • There is no largest natural number. • 0 is the smallest natural number. • The sum of two natural numbers is a natural number. • The product of two natural numbers is a natural number. The Integers Z is used to denote the set of all integers. That is, Z = {. . . , −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, . . .} The integers are the set of natural numbers along with their additive inverses (their negatives). We can think of Z as the set of points on a number line that can be obtained by moving either left or right by a unit length at a time. (Later, we will formally construct this set from N.) Note. We will often use Z+ to denote the set of positive integers. That is, Z+ = {1, 2, 3, 4, . . .} Properties of Z we may assume: • There is neither a largest nor a smallest integer. • The sum, difference, or product of two integers is an integer. 13\n\n We will explore the properties of the integers in more depth in the number theory section of the course, but we will discuss a few basic properties here. Definition (Integer Divisibility). For a, b ∈Z, we say that a divides b, denoted a | b, if and only if there exists an integer c such that b = ac. Example 2.1.5. · 2 | 6 because 6 = 2 · 3. · 3 ∤7 because 7 ̸= 3c for any c ∈Z. · 0 | 0 because 0 = 0 · k for any integer k. · 2 | 0 because 0 = 2 · 0. From the definition of the integer divisibility, we can prove properties of this relation. Theorem 2.1.6 (Transitivity of Divisibility). For any a, b, c ∈Z, if a | b and b | c then a | c. Proof. Assume that a, b, c ∈Z such that a | b and b | c. Then, by definition of integer divisibility, there exists m, n ∈Z such that b = ma and c = nb. We then have the following chain of equalities, using the associativity of multiplication. c = nb = n(ma) = (nm)a Since nm ∈Z, it follows that a | c.", "output": "Think about what proof technique would work best here: direct proof, contrapositive, or contradiction?", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

August 29 3.1. Basic Set Theory 3.1.1. Number Sets The Integers continued Using integer divisibility, we define what it means for an integer to be even or odd. Definition (Even/Odd). An integer n is called even if and only if 2 | n. An integer n is called odd if and only if n is not even, i.e., 2 ∤n. Note. By our definition, every integer is either even or odd, but not both. The following theorem formalizes our basic idea of “division with remainder” from grade school. We will state it without proof for now, but we will prove it in the next couple of weeks, and we will use this theorem heavily in the number theory section. Theorem 3.1.1 (Division Algorithm). Let a, b ∈Z with b ̸= 0. Then there exist unique integers q and r such that a = bq + r with 0 ≤r < |b|. Here, q is called the quotient and r is referred to as the remainder. For example, if a = 44 and b = 7, the only way to write 44 = 7q + r with 0 ≤r < 7 is 44 = 7 · 6 + 2 If a = −44 and b = 7, the only way to write −44 = 7q + r with 0 ≤r < 7 is −44 = 7 · (−7) + 5 And if a = 44 and b = −7, the only way to write 44 = (−7)q + r with 0 ≤r < 7 is 44 = (−7) · (−6) + 2 16\n\n Corollary 3.1.2 (Equivalent Definition of Even/Odd).

The Rational Numbers Q is used to denote the “set of all rational numbers”. That is Q = na b | a, b ∈Z and b ̸= 0 o On a number line, Q represents the set of points obtained by dividing any unit segment into an equal number of parts. For example, dividing each unit into 3 equal parts gives a subset of the rational numbers, as illustrated below. Recall that addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of rational numbers are defined in terms of addition and multiplication of integers: a b + c d = ad + bc bd and a b · c d = ac bd 17\n\n Thus, many properties of the rational numbers can be derived from our assumed properties of the integers. Proposition 3.1.5. The following properties hold for rational numbers: 1. The sum (or difference) of two rational numbers is a rational number. 2. The product of two rational numbers is a rational number. 3. The quotient of two rational numbers, where the divisor is nonzero, is a rational number. We will prove property 1 below. The other properties follow similarly and are left as exercises for the reader. Proof. Let x, y ∈Q. By definition of the rational numbers, there exist integers a, b, c, d ∈ Z with b, d ̸= 0 such that x = a b and y = c d. Then, x + y = a b + c d = ad + bc bd Since ad + bc ∈Z and bd ∈Z with bd ̸= 0, we conclude that x + y ∈Q. Note. In addition to these properties, you may also assume that there is neither a largest nor a smallest rational number. The Real Numbers R denotes the set of real numbers. This set includes all the rational numbers Q, as well as all irrational numbers. In other words, R is the completion of the rationals, filling in all the ”holes” on the number line. Properties of R we may assume: • There is neither a largest nor a smallest real number. • The sum, difference, and product of two real numbers are real numbers. • A real number divided by a nonzero real number is still a real number. • The product of two nonzero real numbers is nonzero. 18\n\n Recall that intervals of real numbers are subsets of R satisfying specific inequalities, as denoted below using set-builder notation. Assume a, b ∈R with a < b: (a, b) = {x ∈R | a < x < b} (a, b] = {x ∈R | a < x ≤b} [a, b) = {x ∈R | a ≤x < b} [a, b] = {x ∈R | a ≤x ≤b} (−∞, b) = {x ∈R | x < b} (−∞, b] = {x ∈R | x ≤b} (a, ∞) = {x ∈R | a < x} [a, ∞) = {x ∈R | a ≤x} Another important subset of the reals to define is the set of irrational numbers. These are real numbers that cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers. Examples include √ 2 and π. Formally, the set of irrational numbers is: {irrational numbers} = {x ∈R | x /∈Q} The Empty Set ∅denotes the empty set, which is the unique set with no elements. Formally, we write: ∅= { } The First n-many Positive Integers For any natural number n ∈N, we use the notation [n] to denote the set of the first n positive integers. Specifically: [n] = {m ∈N | 1 ≤m ≤n} For example: [0] = ∅ [1] = {1} [2] = {1, 2} [3] = {1, 2, 3} ... Note.

We start with the basic words and terminology to make precise, unambiguous mathematical statements and study the structure of propositions. Understanding the structure of propositions will help us determine how to prove or disprove statements. 3.2.1. Propositional Logic The most elementary logic we can study is called propositional logic. In propositional logic, we examine the logical relationships between various mathematical statements based on their sentence structure. To study the structure of propositions, we must have a starting point–our atoms for propositional logic. 20\n\n Definition. An atomic proposition (or atom) is a proposition whose truth value is independent of the truth value of any other proposition. In particular, an atomic proposition cannot be broken down into simpler propositions. In propositional logic, we use propositional variables such as P, Q, R, etc., to denote atomic propositions. We can think of these in the same way we think of variables in algebra; any proposition may be substituted for these propositional variables. For example, we may define the atomic propositions P and Q as: P := “It will rain today.” Q := “Every prime number greater than 2 is odd.” From here, we will build compound statements using logical connectives. The logical connectives for propositional logic are: ∧, ∨, ¬, →, ↔ With these, we can create more complicated propositions such as the following: ¬(P →(¬Q ∧R)) We will define each of these logical connectives one at a time. To aid in this process, we will use a truth table. A truth table is a table used to describe the truth value of a compound proposition under all possible truth values of the atomic propositions within it. If n different atomic propositions appear in the compound statement, then the truth table requires 2n rows. Truth tables are useful for defining logical connectives and proving logical equivalences of various propositions. We now proceed to define each of our connectives. Conjunction Any two propositions can be combined to form a new proposition called the conjunction of the original propositions. A conjunction is translated as “and” and is denoted with the ∧symbol. For propositions P and Q, we define the truth value of the compound proposition P ∧Q as: P ∧Q is true if and only if both P and Q are true. We can summarize this with a truth table: 21\n\n P Q P ∧Q T T T T F F F T F F F F Disjunction We can also combine two propositions to form a new proposition called the disjunction of the original propositions. A disjunction is translated as “or” and is denoted with the ∨symbol. For propositions P and Q, we define the truth value of the compound proposition P ∨Q as: P ∨Q is true if and only if either P is true or Q is true or both. Again, we summarize this with a truth table: P Q P ∨Q T T T T F T F T T F F F Negation Given a single proposition, we can form a new proposition called its logical negation. A negation is translated as “not” and denoted ¬. If P is a proposition, then we define the truth value of ¬P as: ¬P is true if and only if P is false. We present this as a truth table below: P ¬P T F F T Logical Implication Given two propositions P and Q, we can form the compound proposition “if P then Q”, denoted P →Q, known as an implication. We define P →Q to be true unless P is true and Q is false. This is best presented as a truth table: 22\n\n P Q P →Q T T T T F F F T T F F T This is the hardest to understand of the logical connectives but also the most important. To understand the truth table above, it is helpful to view implication as an obligation or contract. For example, suppose the professor were to say: “If you get 100% on the final exam, then you will get an A for the course.” Under what conditions would this statement be false? That is, what would need to happen for the professor to be considered a liar? Hopefully, we can see that the above statement would be a lie only if a student received 100% on the final exam but the professor did not give them an A for the course. Caution: Do not mistake logical implication for causality. While we often read P →Q as “P implies Q” in logic, it does not mean that Q can be deduced from P, as we typically mean when we write proofs. There are many logical implications that are true but are not useful and would not be used in ordinary English. For example, the following proposition is always true: If you are a student at Carnegie Mellon University, then 2 is a prime number. Both P and Q are true, making P →Q true, but there is no causality. Even if you are not a student at Carnegie Mellon University and are reading this statement, it is still true. This brings us to another important point about implications: anytime P is false, P →Q is true. It is often said that a false proposition implies any proposition. There is a famous interaction between logician Bertrand Russell and one of his students when first presented with this idea: Student: “In that case, given that 1 = 0, prove that you are the Pope.” Russell: “Add 1 to both sides of the equation: then we have 2 = 1. The set containing just me and the Pope has 2 members. But 2 = 1, so it has only 1 member; therefore, I am the Pope.” Note that the statement “If 1 = 0, then I am the pope.” would be true regardless of who said it, even the pope. Terminology for P →Q: P is called the antecedent, hypothesis, or supposition. Q is called the consequent or conclusion. Note. If P →Q is true and P is true, then we can deduce that Q must also be true. This rule of inference is known as Modus Ponens and is an essential concept in proof writing. 23\n\n Below we present some additional terminology for variants of P →Q. Definition. Let P and Q be atomic propositions. • The converse of P →Q is Q →P. • The contrapositive of P →Q is ¬Q →¬P. • The inverse of P →Q is ¬P →¬Q. The Biconditional Connective Given two propositions P and Q, we can form the compound proposition “P if and only if Q”, denoted P ↔Q, known as a biconditional statement. We define P ↔Q to be true iff P and Q have the same truth values. This is shown in the truth table below: P Q P ↔Q T T T T F F F T F F F T Definition. If P and Q are propositional formulas and P ↔Q is true for all possible truth values of the atomic propositions, then we say that P and Q are logically equivalent, denoted P ≡Q.", "output": "Think about what proof technique would work best here: direct proof, contrapositive, or contradiction?", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

Propositional Logic Logical Equivalences Logical equivalences between various proposition structures allow us to understand, simplify, negate, and prove various propositions. We take a look at a few important logical equivalences. Theorem 4.1.1 (De Morgan’s Laws for Connectives). For all propositions P and Q, the following logical equivalences hold true: 1. ¬(P ∧Q) ≡(¬P ∨¬Q) 2. ¬(P ∨Q) ≡(¬P ∧¬Q) In propositional logic, we can prove logical equivalences using a truth table. Proof. Let P and Q be arbitrary and fixed propositions. The following truth table verifies that ¬(P ∧Q) ≡(¬P ∨¬Q). P Q P ∧Q ¬(P ∧Q) ¬P ¬Q ¬P ∨¬Q ¬(P ∧Q) ↔(¬P ∨¬Q) T T T F F F F T T F F T F T T T F T F T T F T T F F F T T T T T Note. As we’ve seen a little bit already, we can nest compound propositions as deeply as we like. We use parentheses to disambiguate propositions. We list a few more important logical equivalences. These will be useful for understanding the logical negation of a proposition as well as developing proof techniques for our 26\n\n propositions. All of these theorems are proven via simple truth tables. We’ll state most of them without proof. Theorem 4.1.2 (Distributive Law for Connectives). For all propositions P, Q, and R, the following logical equivalences hold: 1. P ∧(Q ∨R) ≡(P ∧Q) ∨(P ∧R) 2. P ∨(Q ∧R) ≡(P ∨Q) ∧(P ∨R) Theorem 4.1.3 (Law of Double Negation). For any proposition P, ¬¬P ≡P. Theorem 4.1.4 (Commutative Law). For any propositions P and Q, the following are true: 1. P ∧Q ≡Q ∧P 2. P ∨Q ≡Q ∨P Theorem 4.1.5 (Associative Law). For any propositions P, Q, and R, the following are true: 1. (P ∧Q) ∧R ≡P ∧(Q ∧R) 2. (P ∨Q) ∨R ≡P ∨(Q ∨R) The associative law allows us to drop some parentheses in our statement without losing unique readability. If the connectives are all ∧’s or ∨’s, then the parentheses are not necessary. Since (P ∧Q)∧R ≡P ∧(Q∧R), we do not need to disambiguate between these two propositions. We may simply write P ∧Q ∧R. Similarly, we may write P ∨Q ∨R in place of (P ∨Q) ∨R or P ∨(Q ∨R). Note. When the connectives are a mix of ∧’s and ∨’s, we still need parentheses. As we can see from Theorem 4.1.2, P ∧(Q ∨R) ̸≡(P ∧Q) ∨R. Simply writing ”P ∧Q ∨R” is ambiguous and not considered a well-formed proposition. Theorem 4.1.6 (Biconditional Equivalence). For any propositions P and Q, P ↔Q ≡(P →Q) ∧(Q →P). Theorem 4.1.7 (Disjunctive Form of Implication). For any propositions P and Q, P →Q ≡¬P ∨Q. 27\n\n Recall that ¬Q →¬P is called the contrapositive of P →Q. It is an important fact in mathematics that these two sentence structures are always logically equivalent. Later, when we discuss proof writing, this logical equivalence will give us an important proof technique known as a proof by contraposition. Theorem 4.1.8 (Contraposition). For any propositions P and Q, P →Q ≡¬Q →¬P. Proof. Let P and Q be arbitrary and fixed propositions. The following truth table demonstrates the logical equivalence between P →Q and ¬Q →¬P.

(a) If I do my assignments, I will get a good grade in the course. (b) I will not be late unless there is traffic. 4.1.2. Predicate Logic Propositional logic has some severe limitations. For instance, how could we express propositions such as “The square of every real number is nonnegative” or “There exists a negative real number” in propositional logic? To handle statements of this form, we introduce predicate logic. Recall: A predicate or variable proposition is a statement involving free (unbound) variables. A predicate itself does not have a truth value, but it takes on a truth value once its variables are specified. 28\n\n Example 4.1.11. 1. P(x) := x2 ≥8 defined on x ∈R is a predicate. From this predicate, we can form propositions by either specifying the value of x, stating that P(x) is sometimes true, or stating that P(x) is always true. The following are all examples of propositions formed from P(x): • If x = 3 then x2 ≥8. • For all x ∈R, x2 ≥8. • There exists x ∈R such that x2 ≥8. 2. Q(n) := “n is prime” defined on n ∈N is a predicate. The following are all propositions: • Q(0), Q(1), Q(2), etc. • There exists n ∈N such that Q(n) holds. • For all n ∈N, Q(n) holds. In the above examples, one way to turn a predicate into a proposition is to specify how often the predicate holds true. In this case, we say that we have quantified the variables. We now introduce two mathematical symbols, called quantifiers, denoting the English quantifiers “there exists” and “for all.” The Universal Quantifier The symbol ∀is called the universal quantifier and translates as “for all.” If S is a set and P(x) is a predicate defined on x ∈S, then ∀x ∈S, P(x) means “For every x ∈S, P(x) holds true.” Example 4.1.12. We can express the proposition “The square of any real number is nonnegative” symbolically as: ∀x ∈R, x2 ≥0 The predicate here was P(x) := x2 ≥0. Combining this with the universal quantifier turned it into a proposition. Example 4.1.13. Let S be the set of all integers that are not perfect squares (integers that are not the square of another integer). Using the universal quantifier, we can formally define this set as follows: S = {n ∈Z | ∀m ∈Z, n ̸= m2} Note that Q(n) := ∀m ∈Z, n ̸= m2 is still a predicate because n is unbound. Remember that when we use set-builder notation, the right-hand side must be a predicate. 29\n\n The Existential Quantifier The symbol ∃is called the existential quantifier and translates as “there exists.” If S is a set and P(x) is a predicate defined on x ∈S, then ∃x ∈S, P(x) means “There exists an x ∈S such that P(x) holds true.” Example 4.1.14. We can formally express the proposition “The polynomial 2x3 −x2 − 4x + 2 has a rational root” as: ∃x ∈Q, (2x3 −x2 −4x + 2 = 0) Example 4.1.15. If we wish to define E to be the set of even integers, we can express this in set-builder notation using the existential quantifier: E = {n ∈Z | ∃m ∈Z, (n = 2m)} Notes about Predicate Logic • Once the free variables are bound, a predicate becomes a proposition. This means that the logical equivalences from propositional logic still apply. For instance, by the logical equivalence of contraposition we have: ∀x ∈S, ∃y ∈S, (P(x) →Q(y)) ≡∀x ∈S, ∃y ∈S, (¬Q(y) →¬P(x)) • If two adjacent quantifiers of the same type bind variables, then the order of quantification does not matter. For example: ∀x ∈S, ∀y ∈S, P(x, y) ≡∀y ∈S, ∀x ∈S, P(x, y) Because the order does not matter, we may write this in shorthand as: ∀x, y ∈S, P(x, y) • If the adjacent quantifiers are different, then you cannot change their order without changing the meaning of the proposition. Example 4.1.16. Consider the proposition: ∀x ∈Z, ∃y ∈Z, (x < y) This translates to English as “For every integer x, there exists a larger integer y” (a true statement). On the other hand, the proposition ∃y ∈Z, ∀x ∈Z, (x < y) translates to English as “There exists an integer y that is greater than all integers” (a false statement). 30\n\n • Many statements in mathematics concern the existence of a unique element with a special property. If P(x) is a predicate defined on x ∈S and we wish to say that there is one and only one element in S making P(x) true, we can express this formally as: (∃x ∈S, P(x)) ∧(∀a, b ∈S, (P(a) ∧P(b)) →a = b) This states: “There exists an x in S satisfying P(x), and any two elements that satisfy P(x) must be equal.” Because we so often want to express existence and uniqueness in mathematics, we commonly use the shorthand notation ∃!. That is, the proposition ∃! x ∈S, P(x) translates to “There exists a unique x in S such that P(x) holds.” Example 4.1.17. We can restate the Division Algorithm using this shorthand notation: ∀a, b ∈Z, (b ̸= 0 →∃! q, r ∈Z, (a = bq + r ∧0 ≤r < |b|))", "output": "Consider using mathematical induction.

Logic 5.1.1. Predicate Logic Maximally Negating Propositions When proving propositions, it is often helpful to understand the logical negation of a statement, particularly when using proof by contradiction. While ¬P is technically the negation of P, simply saying “not P is true” is not very useful to work with. Instead, we would like to find a proposition Q that is logically equivalent to ¬P, where only the atomic formulas in Q are negated. Such a proposition is called a maximally negated proposition. From our established logical equivalences, we already have most of the tools necessary to maximally negate propositions. The one remaining piece is to determine how to negate quantified statements. Example 5.1.1. Consider the proposition P := ∀x ∈R, ∃y ∈R, (xy = 1). In words, P states: “Every real number has a multiplicative inverse.” Which of the following is logically equivalent to ¬P? (a) No real number has a multiplicative inverse. (b) There is a real number that has a multiplicative inverse. (c) There is a real number that does not have a multiplicative inverse. The correct answer is (c). The statement P claims that every real number has a multiplicative inverse, so it fails if even a single real number lacks one. Symbolically, (c) can be written as ∃x ∈R, ∀y ∈R, (xy ̸= 1). Comparing this negation to the original statement, notice that both quantifiers are switched and the innermost formula is negated. This illustrates the general pattern for negating quantified statements. 32\n\n Theorem 5.1.2 (DeMorgan’s Laws for Quantifiers). For any set S and predicate P(x): 1. ¬ ∀x ∈S, P(x) ≡∃x ∈S, ¬P(x) 2. ¬ ∃x ∈S, P(x) ≡∀x ∈S, ¬P(x) Since these statements involve quantifiers, truth tables cannot be used to establish the equivalences. We prove part (1) directly by showing that each side implies the other. Proof. • Assume ¬ ∀x ∈S, P(x) holds. Then it is not the case that every x ∈S satisfies P(x). Therefore, there must exist some x ∈S for which P(x) does not hold, i.e. ∃x ∈S, ¬P(x). • Conversely, assume ∃x ∈S, ¬P(x) holds. Then for some a ∈S, we have ¬P(a). This means not every element of S satisfies P(x), so ∀x ∈S, P(x) is false. Hence ¬ ∀x ∈S, P(x) is true. Now we have all the tools we need to maximally negate any proposition that we may encounter. Below, we present an example demonstrating a systematic method for finding the maximally negated form of a proposition. In general, you do not need to show these intermediate steps, but we include them here to illustrate the process. Example 5.1.3. Let P(x), Q(y), and R(x, y, z) be variable propositions. Consider the sentence σ given below ∀x ∈S, ∃y ∈S, ∀z ∈S, ((P(x) ∧Q(y)) →R(x, y, z)) We will write ¬σ in maximally negated form. ¬σ ≡¬∀x ∈S, ∃y ∈S, ∀z ∈S, ((P(x) ∧Q(y)) →R(x, y, z)) ≡∃x ∈S, ¬∃y ∈S, ∀z ∈S, ((P(x) ∧Q(y)) →R(x, y, z)) ≡∃x ∈S, ∀y ∈S, ¬∀z ∈S, ((P(x) ∧Q(y)) →R(x, y, z)) ≡∃x ∈S, ∀y ∈S, ∃z ∈S, ¬((P(x) ∧Q(y)) →R(x, y, z)) ≡∃x ∈S, ∀y ∈S, ∃z ∈S, ¬(¬(P(x) ∧Q(y)) ∨R(x, y, z)) ≡∃x ∈S, ∀y ∈S, ∃z ∈S, (¬¬(P(x) ∧Q(y)) ∧¬R(x, y, z)) ≡∃x ∈S, ∀y ∈S, ∃z ∈S, ((P(x) ∧Q(y)) ∧¬R(x, y, z)) Finally, using the associative law for conjunctions, we can simplify the expression by removing unnecessary parentheses without ambiguity. Thus, the maximally negated form of ¬σ is ¬σ ≡∃x ∈S, ∀y ∈S, ∃z ∈S, (P(x) ∧Q(y) ∧¬R(x, y, z)) 33\n\n Recipe for Finding a Maximally Negated Form 1. Move negations inward. Start with the outermost negation and apply the rules for negating quantifiers: ¬∀x ∈S, P(x) ≡∃x ∈S, ¬P(x), ¬∃x ∈S, P(x) ≡∀x ∈S, ¬P(x). 2. Push negations through connectives. Use DeMorgan’s Laws and doublenegation elimination: ¬(A ∧B) ≡(¬A ∨¬B), ¬(A ∨B) ≡(¬A ∧¬B), ¬¬A ≡A. 3. Rewrite implications. Replace A →B with ¬A ∨B before pushing negations inside. 4. Repeat until only atomic formulas are negated. Continue applying the rules until no quantifiers or connectives have a negation directly in front of them. At the end of this process, you will have a maximally negated form of the original proposition.", "output": "Think about what proof technique would work best here: direct proof, contrapositive, or contradiction?", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

Proof Writing Now that we have studied the structure of propositions and their negations, we are ready to discuss strategies for proving or disproving mathematical statements. We will break this discussion into steps, beginning with quantifiers and then moving on to implications and biconditionals. For each type of claim, we will examine both direct proofs and indirect proofs. A direct proof attempts to establish the truth of the statement as written. An indirect proof instead establishes the truth of a logically equivalent statement (for example, a contrapositive or the negation of the negation). 34\n\n 5.2.1. Universal Statements A universal statement is a proposition of the form ∀x ∈S, P(x). Direct Proofs Direct Proof Strategy Let x ∈S be arbitrary but fixed. Demonstrate that P(x) is true. Since x ∈S was chosen arbitrarily, we may conclude that ∀x ∈S, P(x) is true. As a common and important case, recall that for two sets A and B, we say A ⊆B if and only if ∀a ∈A, (a ∈B). To prove A ⊆B, we let a ∈A be arbitrary and then show that a ∈B. Proofs of this form are often called containment proofs, because we are showing that the set B “contains” all elements of A. Example 5.2.1. Let A = {n ∈Z | ∃m ∈Z, n = 10m −15} and B = {n ∈Z | ∃m ∈Z, n = 5m}. Prove that A ⊆B. Proof. Let a ∈A be an arbitrary and fixed element. By definition of A, there exists m ∈Z such that a = 10m −15. Fix such an m. Factoring out a 5, we obtain a = 10m −15 = 5(2m −3). Since 2m −3 ∈Z, it follows that a = 5k for some integer k (namely k = 2m −3). Hence a ∈B. Because a was arbitrary, we conclude that A ⊆B. Note. In early proofs, it is important to explicitly emphasize that an element chosen from a set is both arbitrary and fixed. This reminds us that we are not working with a special example, but with a general placeholder element. Later, once this point has been internalized, we will typically write simply “Let a ∈A,” with the arbitrariness and fixedness of a understood from context. Indirect Proofs By Theorem 5.1.2, we know that ¬∀x ∈S, P(x) ≡ ∃x ∈S, ¬P(x). 35\n\n Indirect Proof Strategy To prove ∀x ∈S, P(x) indirectly, assume for the sake of contradiction (AFSOC) that ∃x ∈S, ¬P(x) holds. Fix such an x and proceed through a chain of logical deductions until you arrive at a contradiction. Conclude that ∀x ∈S, P(x) must be true. Example 5.2.2. Prove that ∀x, y ∈Z, x2 −4y2 ̸= 2. Proof. Assume for the sake of contradiction that there exist integers x, y ∈Z such that x2 −4y2 = 2. Fix such an x and y. Since x is an integer, it is either even or odd. We consider both cases. • Case 1: Suppose x is even. Then x = 2k for some k ∈Z. Fix such a k. Substituting into the equation gives (2k)2 −4y2 = 2 =⇒ 4k2 −4y2 = 2. Thus 4(k2 −y2) = 2, which implies 4 | 2, a contradiction. • Case 2: Suppose x is odd. Then, by the division algorithm, x = 2ℓ+ 1 for some ℓ∈Z. Fix such an ℓ. Substituting into the equation gives (2ℓ+ 1)2 −4y2 = 2 =⇒ 4ℓ2 + 4ℓ+ 1 −4y2 = 2. Rearranging, 4(ℓ2 + ℓ−y2) = 1. Since ℓ2 + ℓ−y2 ∈Z, this would imply 4 | 1, a contradiction. Since both cases lead to contradictions, our assumption was false. Therefore, ∀x, y ∈Z, x2 −4y2 ̸= 2.", "output": "Think about what proof technique would work best here: direct proof, contrapositive, or contradiction?", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

Existential Statements An existential statement is a proposition of the form ∃x ∈S, P(x). 36\n\n Direct Proofs Direct Proof Strategy Demonstrate that there exists x ∈S such that P(x) holds. The most common approach is a proof by demonstration, where we provide a concrete example of an element x ∈S that satisfies P(x). Example 5.2.5. Prove ∃x ∈Q, (2x3 −x2 −4x + 2 = 0). Proof. Let f(x) = 2x3 −x2 −4x + 2. Note that we can factor f(x) as follows: 2x3 −x2 −4x + 2 = (2x −1)(x2 −2) Now, consider x = 1 2 ∈Q. Then f \u0000 1 2 \u0001 = (1 −1) \u0000 1 4 −2 \u0001 = 0 Therefore, there exists x ∈Q such that f(x) = 0, as desired. A proof by demonstration is also commonly used to disprove a universal statement by providing a counterexample. Specifically, to prove ¬∀x ∈S, P(x), it suffices to demonstrate that ∃x ∈S, ¬P(x). Example 5.2.6. Recall in Example 5.2.1 we proved that A ⊆B where A = {n ∈Z | ∃m ∈Z, n = 10m −15} and B = {n ∈Z | ∃m ∈Z, n = 5m} Now, prove that B ̸⊆A. To disprove the universal statement ∀b ∈B, (b ∈A), we need to find a counterexample showing ∃b ∈B, (b /∈A). Counterexample. Consider b = 0. We see that 0 ∈B because 0 = 5 · 0 and 0 ∈Z. However, 0 /∈A because 0 = 10m −15 if and only if m = 3 2, which is not an integer. Therefore, B ̸⊆A. 37\n\n 6. September 8 6.1. Proof Writing 6.1.1. Existential Statements Direct Proofs In addition to constructive proofs, we may also encounter non-constructive direct proofs. These establish the existence of certain elements without explicitly identifying them. The following is a classic example. Example 6.1.1. Claim: There exist two irrational numbers a and b such that ab ∈Q. We will demonstrate that such a and b exist without explicitly identifying them. For the purposes of this proof, assume that √ 2 is irrational (a fact we will soon prove). Proof. Consider √ 2 √ 2. This number is either rational or irrational. We consider both cases. • Case 1: √ 2 √ 2 ∈Q. Then a = √ 2 and b = √ 2 satisfy the claim. • Case 2: √ 2 √ 2 /∈Q. Then a = √ 2 √ 2 and b = √ 2 satisfy the claim because ab = \u0012√ 2 √ 2\u0013√ 2 = √ 2 2 = 2 ∈Q. Since one of these two cases must hold, we conclude that there exist irrational numbers a and b such that ab ∈Q. Many other common examples of non-constructive direct proofs exist. For instance, numerous proofs invoking the Mean Value Theorem or the Intermediate Value Theorem are non-constructive, since these theorems assert the existence of certain points but do not provide a way to find them explicitly. 38\n\n Indirect Proofs By Theorem 5.1.2, we know that ¬∃x ∈S, P(x) ≡∀x ∈S, ¬P(x). Indirect Proof Strategy Assume for the sake of contradiction that ∀x ∈S, ¬P(x) holds. Derive a contradiction from this assumption. Conclude that ∃x ∈S, P(x) must be true. A famous example of an indirect proof of an existential statement is the Pigeonhole Principle. Before stating and proving this theorem, we first need to define the floor and ceiling functions. Definition. Let x ∈R. • The floor of x, denoted ⌊x⌋, is the greatest integer n such that n ≤x. Equivalently, ⌊x⌋is the unique integer n ∈Z such that n ≤x < n + 1. • The ceiling of x, denoted ⌈x⌉, is the least integer n such that x ≤n. Equivalently, ⌈x⌉is the unique integer n ∈Z such that n −1 < x ≤n. Theorem 6.1.2 (Pigeonhole Principle). Let n, k ∈Z+. If n objects are placed into k boxes, then there exists a box containing at least ln k m objects. We will state this theorem more formally after our discussion of cardinality. Colloquially, the Pigeonhole Principle is often stated as: “If many pigeons fly into not very many pigeonholes, then at least one pigeonhole must contain multiple pigeons.” Proof. Suppose objects a1, a2, . . . , an are placed into boxes A1, A2, . . . , Ak. Assume for the sake of contradiction that ∀i ∈[k], Ai contains fewer than ln k m objects. Since each Ai contains an integer number of objects, this means ∀i ∈[k], Ai contains at most ln k m −1 objects. By definition of the ceiling function we have ln k m −1 < n k ≤ ln k m 39\n\n Therefore, the total number of objects in all k boxes is at most k · \u0010ln k m −1 \u0011 < k · n k = n, contradicting the fact that exactly n objects were placed into the boxes. Hence, there must exist some i ∈[k] such that Ai contains at least ln k m objects.", "output": "Think about what proof technique would work best here: direct proof, contrapositive, or contradiction?", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

Conditional Statements Conditional statements are those of the form P →Q. Proofs of conditional statements are the most common type of proofs in mathematics. We now build on what we established with universal and existential statements to include this connective. Direct Proofs Direct Proof Strategy Assume P is true. Show that Q must also be true. We previously saw an example of this proof method when we proved Theorem 2.1.6 about the transitivity of divisibility. Symbolically, we can express this theorem as: ∀a, b, c ∈Z ((a | b ∧b | c) →a | c) To prove this, we let a, b, and c be arbitrary integers such that a | b and b | c. We then demonstrated, using the definition of divisibility, that a | c. Let’s look at another example of this proof technique. Example 6.1.5. Claim: For all integers n, if n is even then n2 is even. Symbolically, we can express this statement as ∀n ∈Z, \u0010 (∃m ∈Z, n = 2m) →(∃ℓ∈Z, n2 = 2ℓ) \u0011 . 40\n\n Proof. Let n ∈Z be arbitrary and fixed. Suppose that n is even. Then there exists m ∈Z such that n = 2m. Fix such an m. Squaring both sides of the equation gives n2 = (2m)2 = 4m2 = 2(2m2). Let ℓ= 2m2 ∈Z. Then n2 = 2ℓ, which shows that n2 is even, as desired. Indirect Proofs There are two types of indirect proofs for conditional statements that are often very similar: proof by contraposition and proof by contradiction. 1 (Proof by Contraposition) Recall the contrapositive logical equivalence from Theorem 4.1.8: P →Q ≡¬Q →¬P. Contrapositive Proof Strategy Assume ¬Q is true. Show that ¬P must also be true. 2 (Proof by Contradiction) From Theorem 4.1.7 (the disjunctive form of implication) and Theorem 4.1.1 (De Morgan’s laws) we have ¬(P →Q) ≡P ∧¬Q. Contradiction Proof Strategy Assume for the sake of contradiction that P ∧¬Q holds. Find a contradiction based on this assumption. Conclude that P →Q must hold. To see an example of the former, let’s look at the converse of Example 6.1.5. Example 6.1.6. Claim: For all integers n, if n2 is even then n is even. Symbolically, we can express this proposition as ∀n ∈Z, ((∃k ∈Z, n2 = 2k) →(∃ℓ∈Z, n = 2ℓ)). By Contraposition. Let n ∈Z (be arbitrary and fixed). It suffices to show that if n is not even, then n2 is also not even. Assume that n is not even, i.e., n is odd. Then there exists ℓ∈Z such that n = 2ℓ+ 1. Fix such an ℓ. Then n2 = (2ℓ+ 1)2 = 4ℓ2 + 4ℓ+ 1 = 2(2ℓ2 + 2ℓ) + 1. Since 2ℓ2 + 2ℓ∈Z, we have n2 = 2k + 1 for some k ∈Z. Hence n2 is odd, and therefore n2 is not even, as desired. 41\n\n We now look at a proof by contradiction. Example 6.1.7. Using the definition of the rational numbers and the properties of the integers, prove that for any real numbers x and y, if x is rational and y is irrational then x + y is irrational. Symbolically, we can express this proposition as ∀x, y ∈R, ((x ∈Q ∧y /∈Q) →x + y /∈Q). By Contradiction. Let x, y ∈R such that x ∈Q and y /∈Q. Assume for the sake of contradiction that x + y ∈Q. Since x, x + y ∈Q, there exist m, n, p, q ∈Z with n, q ̸= 0 such that x = m n and x + y = p q . Fix m, n, p, q. Then y = (x + y) −x = p q −m n = np −mq nq . Since np −mq, nq ∈Z with nq ̸= 0 (because n ̸= 0 and q ̸= 0), this implies that y ∈Q, contradicting our assumption that y /∈Q. Therefore x+y /∈Q, and the claim holds.", "output": "Think about what proof technique would work best here: direct proof, contrapositive, or contradiction?", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

Proof Writing 7.1.1. Biconditional Statements Biconditional statements are propositions of the form P ↔Q (read: “P if and only if Q,” or simply “P iff Q”). There are two common techniques for proving biconditional statements. 1 Standard Method: Prove both P →Q and Q →P separately, using any of the techniques from the previous section. These proofs together establish the biconditional. 2 Intermediary Method: Construct a chain of logical equivalences. Prove P ⇔A ⇔B ⇔· · · ⇔Q for some number of intermediate propositions A, B, . . .. Each step must be reversible when using this method. Standard Method Standard Method Prove both directions separately: • Assume P and show Q. • Assume Q and show P. Observe that if we combine our proofs from Examples 6.1.5 and 6.1.6, we have shown that for any integer n, n is even if and only if n2 is even. We state this as a proposition. Proposition 7.1.1. For all n ∈Z, n is even iff n2 is even. We now prove a more general version of this result. 43\n\n Theorem 7.1.2. For all m, n ∈Z, mn is even iff m is even or n is even. Proof. Let m, n ∈Z be arbitrary and fixed. (⇒) We prove the contrapositive. Suppose neither m nor n is even, so both are odd. Then there exist r, s ∈Z such that m = 2r + 1 and n = 2s + 1. Fix r and s. Then mn = (2r + 1)(2s + 1) = 2(2rs + r + s) + 1. Since 2rs + r + s ∈Z, we see that mn is odd. Thus, if mn is even, then at least one of m or n must be even. (⇐) Suppose either m is even or n is even. We consider two cases. ▶Case 1: m is even. Then m = 2k for some k ∈Z, so mn = (2k)n = 2(kn). Since kn ∈Z, mn is even. ▶Case 2: n is even. Then n = 2ℓfor some ℓ∈Z, so mn = m(2ℓ) = 2(mℓ). Since mℓ∈Z, mn is even. In either case, mn is even. Note. In the backward direction, Cases 1 and 2 were identical except for the distinction of which integer we labeled as “m” and which we labeled as “n”. In such situations we may simplify the proof by assuming just one case holds “without loss of generality” (abbreviated WLOG). “Without loss of generality” means we can assume a specific case because it represents all possible cases without limiting the general argument. Example 7.1.3. Here is a streamlined proof of the backward direction of Theorem 7.1.2 using WLOG. Proof. (⇐): Suppose either m or n is even. Without loss of generality, assume m is even. Then m = 2r for some r ∈Z. Fix r. Then mn = (2r)n = 2(rn). Since rn ∈Z, mn is even, as required. 44\n\n Notes about Disjunctions 1 To prove (P ∨Q) →R directly, break into cases: • Case 1: Assume P holds. Prove R holds. • Case 2: Assume Q holds. Prove R holds. If the two cases are symmetrical, we may use “without loss of generality” (WLOG). 2 To prove P →(Q ∨R): • (Direct Proof) Assume P and ¬Q. Prove R. • (Indirect Proof) Use contraposition: assume ¬Q and ¬R, and prove ¬P. Example 7.1.4. In the forward direction of Theorem 7.1.2, we previously used contraposition. Below we rewrite the proof using a direct method. Proof. (⇒): Let m, n ∈Z such that mn is even. Then mn = 2k for some k ∈Z. Fix k. We want to show that either m is even or n is even. If m is even, the proof is complete. Otherwise, m is odd, so m = 2ℓ+ 1 for some ℓ∈Z. Fix ℓ. Then 2k = mn = (2ℓ+ 1)n = 2ℓn + n. Rearranging yields n = 2k −2ℓn = 2(k −ℓn). Since k −ℓn ∈Z, it follows that n is even. Thus, either m or n is even, as required. The Intermediary Method Intermediary Method Construct a sequence of reversible logical steps: P ⇔A ⇔B ⇔· · · ⇔Q. Creating a chain of logical equivalences in which each step is reversible can be challenging. Proofs by equivalence chains are most effective for simple propositions where each step is justified by a definition, algebraic manipulation, or a previously proven biconditional statement. We will see more examples of this when we return to set theory. Below is a straightforward illustration. 45\n\n Example 7.1.5. Claim: For all x, y ∈R, x3 + x2y = y2 + xy if and only if y = x2 or y = −x. Proof. Let x, y ∈R be arbitrary and fixed. We construct the following chain of logical equivalences: x3 + x2y = y2 + xy ⇔x3 + x2y −y2 −xy = 0 ⇔(x2 −y)(x + y) = 0 ⇔(x2 −y = 0) or (x + y = 0) ⇔y = x2 or y = −x. Each step follows by reversible algebraic manipulation, so the equivalences are valid in both directions. Therefore, the original biconditional statement holds. Note. When using the Intermediary Method, every step must be a reversible logical equivalence. If even one step only works in one direction, the entire chain fails to justify the biconditional. This contrasts with direct proofs, where one-way implications are often sufficient. Always double-check that each transformation can be undone.", "output": "Consider using mathematical induction.

Show that x = y. Recall that when we introduced the integers, we stated the Division Algorithm in Theorem 3.1.1. We restate it here in the case where b > 0. 46\n\n Theorem 7.1.8 (Division Algorithm). For any a, b ∈Z with b > 0, there exist unique q, r ∈Z such that a = bq + r with 0 ≤r < b. To prove this theorem, we must show both the existence of such q and r, and that they are the only integers satisfying a = bq + r with 0 ≤r < b. We will prove the existence portion later, when we study induction. For now, we prove the uniqueness portion. Uniqueness. Let q1, q2, r1, r2 ∈Z satisfy a = bq1 + r1 = bq2 + r2, 0 ≤r1 < b, 0 ≤r2 < b. From the inequalities, we obtain −b < −r2 ≤0. Adding this to 0 ≤r1 < b gives −b < r1 −r2 < b. Since bq1 + r1 = bq2 + r2, it follows that r1 −r2 = b(q2 −q1). Thus r1 −r2 is a multiple of b. Dividing the inequality −b < r1 −r2 < b by b yields −1 < q2 −q1 < 1. Because q2 −q1 ∈Z, we must have q2 −q1 = 0, so q1 = q2. Substituting back gives r1 −r2 = b(q2 −q1) = 0, hence r1 = r2.

Clearly state any assumptions or conditions needed for your proof. For example, if you assume that a function is continuous or that a set is non-empty, make sure to state this explicitly at the beginning of the proof. 47\n\n • Check Your Proof’s Structure. Ensure that your proof has a clear structure with a defined start, body, and conclusion. The proof should lead logically from the hypotheses to the conclusion, and each part of the proof should contribute to this progression. • Include All Steps. Don’t skip steps when writing your proofs. It is important for your reader to follow your work. Even if a step seems obvious to you, include it. Your intended audience should be able to completely understand and verify your proof. • Explain Why Steps Are Valid. Each step should be correct and clearly justified. If a step relies on a theorem or lemma, briefly mention this and explain why the application is valid. • Define New Variables or Notation. When introducing new variables or notation, be clear. For example, instead of writing “Since n is even, n = 2m,” write “Since n is even, there exists an integer m such that n = 2m.” • Use First Person Plural. Proofs should be written in the first person plural using the pronoun “we.” For instance, “We then have. . . ” or “We now see that. . . ” • Use Complete Sentences. Good mathematical writing uses complete sentences. Your proof should be a short work of mathematical prose, with correct grammar, sentence structure, and punctuation. Students writing proofs for the first time often feel like they’re not allowed to use words because they’re “not math.” A page full of just a series of mathematical symbols might look impressive, but it usually makes your argument harder to follow. Words (and even diagrams) are often necessary to explain your arguments. Notation should be used in moderation to improve readability and precision. • Indicate Directions in Biconditional Proofs. When proving biconditional claims, clearly indicate which direction of the proposition you are proving. For instance, if you are proving P ↔Q, your proof should have two parts: (⇒): Prove P →Q (⇐): Prove Q →P • Use Appropriate Notation. Use the appropriate notation for the context. For example, instead of writing “Let a ∈X,” it is better to write “Let x ∈X” or “Let a ∈A.” Avoid confusing notations like “Let X ∈A × B.” Instead, write “Let (a, b) ∈A × B.” • Revise and Refine. After completing a proof, review it to check for clarity and accuracy. Look for any parts that might be confusing or ambiguous and revise them. Rewriting parts of the proof in simpler terms can also help clarify your arguments. 48\n\n Coming Up With Proofs • Determine Hypotheses. Identify your hypotheses clearly. The proposition is likely not true without these hypotheses. • Clarify the Goal. Determine exactly what you are trying to show. • Use Scratch Work. The order in which we come up with a proof is often not the order in which we write it. Do some scratch work first. Work both forward from the assumptions and backward from the desired conclusion. Ideally, find a place in between where they meet. • Look for Similar Proofs. Consider how the proof of the proposition may be similar to previous proofs you have seen. Look through example problems from the text, lecture notes, unassigned problems, or worksheets. Are there ideas from any of these proofs that you can apply to your current problem? • Check Definitions. When stuck, review your definitions. For instance, if you have assumed that 5 | n, how can you rewrite n from the definition of divisibility? • Use Concrete Examples. Try finding a concrete example that meets the hypotheses. Can you see how the conclusion follows from the hypotheses for this specific example? • Search for Counterexamples. Try finding a counterexample. If the proposition is true, you’ll fail, but you may see what obstacles are causing you to fail. This should aid you in determining why the proposition is true. • Proceed by Contradiction. If you want to prove P →Q, consider what goes wrong if P ∧¬Q is true. With this added knowledge, you may be able to rewrite your proof as a direct proof or a proof by contrapositive. Common Mistakes • Avoid Variable Duplication. Avoid using the same variable for multiple purposes. For instance, instead of writing “Since m and n are even, m = 2k and n = 2k for some k ∈Z,” write “Since m and n are even, m = 2k and n = 2ℓfor some k, ℓ∈Z.” • Understand Definitions. Common errors often result from misunderstanding definitions. Formal definitions are essential for mathematics. Any math course consists of many new definitions, and it is important to learn these. Students often don’t know how to proceed with a proof because they don’t understand the definition of the object they are working with. 49\n\n General Advice • Practice Regularly. To write proofs, you need to be able to think abstractly and lay out a mathematical argument appropriately. Thinking abstractly and laying out a mathematical argument takes practice. Be patient. It comes with time. • Incorporate Feedback. If you are working in a collaborative setting or if you have access to mentors or peers, seek feedback on your proofs. They might offer insights or highlight areas where the proof can be improved. • Work on Proof Readability. Aim for readability and coherence in your proofs. Avoid overly complex sentences or convoluted reasoning. The goal is not just to prove something but to make it understandable for others. • Understand Presented Proofs. Make sure to understand the proofs presented in lectures and recitations. This can help you understand the type of reasoning involved in a proof. Often, rewriting proofs by hand in your own words can help solidify your understanding of the ideas within the proof. • Don’t Rely Solely on Posted", "output": "Think about what proof technique would work best here: direct proof, contrapositive, or contradiction?", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

We want to show that A ∩B = A. From property (3), we already know A ∩B ⊆A. It remains to show A ⊆A ∩B. Let a ∈A. Since A ⊆B, we also have a ∈B. Thus a ∈A ∩B by definition of intersection.

Let I be a set. A family of sets indexed by I, or simply an indexed family of sets, is a collection where each element of I corresponds to a set Ai. The set I is called an index set. We typically denote the indexed family of sets as either {Ai | i ∈I} or {Ai}i∈I. Example 8.1.8. For each i ∈N, define Ai = [2i + 1] ∖[i]. 56\n\n Then F = {Ai | i ∈N} is a family of sets indexed by N. Each set Ai has an explicit definition in terms of i (this is common). For instance: A0 = [1] ∖[0] = {1}, A1 = [3] ∖[1] = {2, 3}, A2 = [5] ∖[2] = {3, 4, 5}, A3 = [7] ∖[3] = {4, 5, 6, 7}. Definition. Let {Ai}i∈I be an indexed family of sets. We define: • Indexed Intersection: \\ i∈I Ai = {x ∈U | ∀i ∈I, x ∈Ai}. • Indexed Union: [ i∈I Ai = {x ∈U | ∃i ∈I, x ∈Ai}. Example 8.1.9. Consider the family of sets from Example 8.1.8. We determine its indexed intersection and union. Claim 1. T i∈N Ai = ∅. Proof. Assume for the sake of contradiction that there exists x ∈T i∈N Ai. Then, by definition of an indexed intersection, x ∈Ai for all i ∈N. Therefore, x ∈A0 and x ∈A1, and hence x ∈A0 ∩A1. However, A0 ∩A1 = {1} ∩{2, 3} = ∅, a contradiction. Hence T i∈N Ai = ∅. Claim 2: S i∈N Ai = Z+ Proof. (⊆) Let x ∈S i∈N Ai. By definition of an indexed union, x ∈Ai for some i ∈N. Fix such an i. From the definition of Ai, we have x ∈[2i + 1] ∖[i] and hence x ∈[2i + 1] by the definition of a set difference. Since x ∈[2i + 1], it follows that x ∈Z+. Therefore, S i∈N Ai ⊆Z+. 57\n\n (⊇) Let x ∈Z+ be arbitrary and fixed. Consider Ax−1 = [2x −1] ∖[x −1]. Since x ≥1, we have x −1 ≥0 and 2x −1 ≥x. Thus x ∈[2x −1]. Moreover, since x > x −1, we have x /∈[x −1]. Hence x ∈Ax−1 by definition of set difference. Therefore x ∈S i∈N Ai by definition of an indexed union. Since x was arbitrary, we conclude that Z+ ⊆S i∈N Ai. By double containment, S i∈N Ai = Z+.", "output": "Try to express this using set notation and apply the relevant set operations or identities.", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

Sets Part 2 9.1.1. De Morgan’s Laws for Sets In propositional logic, De Morgan’s Laws describe how negation interacts with conjunctions and disjunctions. These laws have direct analogs in set theory, where they describe the relationship between set complements, unions, and intersections. Understanding these laws helps us manipulate and simplify expressions involving sets, just as in logic. Theorem 9.1.1 (DeMorgan’s Laws). If A, X, Y are sets, then 1. A ∖(X ∪Y ) = (A ∖X) ∩(A ∖Y ) 2. A ∖(X ∩Y ) = (A ∖X) ∪(A ∖Y ) Additionally, let {Xi | i ∈I} be an indexed family of sets. Then 3. A ∖S i∈I Xi = T i∈I (A ∖Xi) 4. A ∖T i∈I Xi = S i∈I (A ∖Xi) We will prove the fourth statement. The remaining cases follow in a similar way. Proof of (4). Let A be a set and {Xi | i ∈I} an indexed family of sets. We prove that A ∖ \\ i∈I Xi = [ i∈I (A ∖Xi) by double containment. (⊆) Suppose a ∈A ∖T i∈I Xi. Then a ∈A and a /∈T i∈I Xi, by definition of set difference. By the definition of an indexed intersection, there exists some j ∈I such that a /∈Xj. Fix such a j. Since a ∈A and a /∈Xj, we have that a ∈A ∖Xi. By the definition of an indexed union, it follows that a ∈S i∈I (A ∖Xi). Therefore, A ∖T i∈I Xi ⊆S i∈I (A ∖Xi). 59\n\n (⊇) Let a ∈S i∈I (A∖Xi). By the definition of an indexed union, there exists some j ∈I such that a ∈A ∖Xj. Fix such a j. By the definition of set difference, a ∈A and a /∈Xj. Since a /∈Xj, it follows that a /∈T i∈I Xi. Therefore, a ∈A ∖T i∈I Xi. Thus S i∈I(A ∖Xi) ⊆A ∖T i∈I Xi. By double containment, we conclude that A ∖ \\ i∈I Xi = [ i∈I (A ∖Xi). Corollary 9.1.2. Let A and B be subsets of a universal set U. Then 1. A ∩B = A ∪B 2. A ∪B = A ∩B 9.1.2. Cartesian Products In set theory, the Cartesian product of two sets provides a way to pair each element of one set with each element of another set. This operation is fundamental in many areas of mathematics, allowing us to construct ordered pairs and define relations and functions. The Cartesian product helps us explore the relationships between different sets in a structured manner. Definition. Let A and B be sets. The Cartesian product of A and B, denoted A × B is defined as follows: A × B = {(a, b) | a ∈A ∧b ∈B} where the elements (a, b) ∈A × B are ordered pairs. The defining property of an ordered pair is that for a, c ∈A and b, d ∈B (a, b) = (c, d) if and only if a = c and b = d. Note. To be precise, in formal set theory, an object having the same properties as an ordered pair can be defined using the Kuratowski definition: (a, b) = {{a}, {a, b}} Using this construction, the Cartesian product A × B is the set of all such ordered pairs where the first element is from A and the second element is from B. This formalism 60\n\n ensures that the order of the elements in the pair is maintained, which is crucial for distinguishing between (a, b) and (b, a) when a ̸= b. Example 9.1.3. N × Z = {(m, n) | m ∈N and n ∈Z} Z × N = {(m, n) | m ∈Z and n ∈N} Notice that Cartesian products are not commutative. N × Z ̸= Z × N. For instance, (0, −1) ∈N×Z but (0, −1) /∈Z×N because −1 /∈N. In fact, the only time A×B = B×A is when A and B are the same set, or when one of them is empty. Example 9.1.4. In the case where A and B are the same set, it is common to use exponential notation to represent the Cartesian product of the set with itself. This is seen most often in algebra and calculus when we talk about the Cartesian plane: R2 = R × R = {(x, y) | x, y ∈R} The Cartesian plane is simply the set of all possible ordered pairs of real numbers. Example 9.1.5. For any set A, we have A × ∅= ∅× A = ∅. Repeated Cartesian Products If we wanted to take a Cartesian product of three sets, there are a couple of ways we may do this: (A × B) × C = {((a, b), c) | a ∈A, b ∈B, c ∈C} A × (B × C) = {(a, (b, c)) | a ∈A, b ∈B, c ∈C} Although these sets are technically different, they are essentially the same in practice. There is a natural way to associate elements of (A×B)×C with elements of A×(B×C). Specifically, we can identify ((a, b), c) in (A × B) × C with (a, (b, c)) in A × (B × C). Therefore, the distinction in parentheses does not add meaningful information. To simplify notation, we typically drop the parentheses when dealing with repeated Cartesian products. We define an ordered triple (a, b, c) in the same way as an ordered pair, and extend the Cartesian product to three sets as follows: A × B × C = {(a, b, c) | a ∈A, b ∈B, c ∈C} If you have taken Calculus 3, you have likely worked extensively with ordered triples already. Just as the Cartesian plane is represented by R2, the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system is given by R3 = R × R × R = {(x, y, z) | x, y, z ∈R} 61\n\n More generally, if n ∈Z+ and A1, A2, . . . , An are sets, then A1 × A2 × · · · × An = n Y i=1 Ai = {(a1, a2, . . . , an) | a1 ∈A1 ∧a2 ∈A2 ∧· · · ∧an ∈An} where (a1, a2, . . . , an) is called an n-tuple. Example 9.1.6. Let R+ = (0, ∞), the set of positive real numbers. For each r ∈R+, define Ar = {(x, y) ∈R2 | 0 < y < −r 4x2 + r}. Also define B = {(x, y) ∈R2 | −2 < x < 2 and y > 0}. 1. Provide a graphical representation of A1, A4, and B. 2. Prove that S r∈R+ Ar = B. Proof. We proceed by double containment. (⊆) Let (x, y) ∈ S r∈R+ Ar be arbitrary and fixed. By definition of an indexed union we have (x, y) ∈Ar for some r ∈R+. Fix such an r. By definition of Ar we have 0 < y < −r 4x2 + r. Factoring gives −r 4x2 + r = −r 4(x2 −4) = −r 4(x −2)(x + 2). Since y > 0, the right-hand side must also be positive, which forces (x − 2)(x+2) < 0. This implies that (x−2) and (x+2) have opposite signs. Since x + 2 > x −2 it must be the case that x + 2 > 0 and x −2 < 0, which gives us that −2 < x < 2. Combining this with y > 0, we conclude (x, y) ∈B, as desired. 62\n\n (⊇) Let (x, y) ∈B be arbitrary and fixed. Then y > 0 and −2 < x < 2, so (x −2)(x + 2) < 0. We want r > 0 such that y < −r 4(x −2)(x + 2). Scratch Work: y < −r 4(x −2)(x + 2) ⇐⇒ − 4y (x −2)(x + 2) < r We know there must exist a positive real number greater than − 4y (x −2)(x + 2). We use this to continue the proof. Fix any r > − 4y (x −2)(x + 2). We observe that since y > 0, (x−2)(x+2) < 0, and − 4y (x −2)(x + 2) < r it must be the case that y < −r 4(x−2)(x+2). Thus we have (x, y) ∈R2 and 0 < y < −r 4(x −2)(x + 2), and therefore (x, y) ∈Ar. By definition of an indexed union, (x, y) ∈ S r∈R+ Ar, as desired. Since we have shown both containments, it follows that [ r∈R+ Ar = B.", "output": "Think about what proof technique would work best here: direct proof, contrapositive, or contradiction?", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

Set Equality via Logical Equivalences Set equality can always be viewed as a biconditional statement, which is why double containment proofs and biconditional proofs share a similar structure. Let U be a universal set containing two sets A and B. Then the statement A = B can be written symbolically as ∀x ∈U, (x ∈A ↔x ∈B). Recall that one way to prove a biconditional statement is by constructing a chain of logical equivalences. This method can also be applied to sets. It is particularly useful when the proof relies on definitions, algebraic manipulations, or previously established biconditional results. However, it is important to recognize that this approach may not be suitable for all proofs, especially those that require more nuanced or intricate reasoning beyond straightforward equivalences. Before we do an example, we first need a lemma that will serve as a useful intermediary result. 64\n\n Lemma 9.1.11. For any sets A, B, and C, we have C ⊆A ∩B if and only if C ⊆A and C ⊆B. Proof. Let A, B, and C be sets. (⇒) Assume C ⊆A ∩B. To show C ⊆A and C ⊆B, let c ∈C. Since C ⊆A ∩B, we have c ∈A ∩B. By the definition of intersection, c ∈A and c ∈B. Thus C ⊆A and C ⊆B. (⇐) Assume C ⊆A and C ⊆B. To show C ⊆A ∩B, let c ∈C. Then c ∈A and c ∈B, so by the definition of intersection, c ∈A ∩B. Hence C ⊆A ∩B. With this lemma established, we can now prove the following proposition using a chain of logical equivalences. Proposition 9.1.12. For all sets A and B, P(A) ∩P(B) = P(A ∩B). Proof. Let A and B be sets, and let U be a universal set containing P(A) and P(B). Fix an arbitrary X ∈U. Then: X ∈P(A) ∩P(B) ⇔ X ∈P(A) ∧X ∈P(B) (Defn of Intersection) ⇔ X ⊆A ∧X ⊆B (Defn of Power Set) ⇔ X ⊆A ∩B (Lemma 9.1.11) ⇔ X ∈P(A ∩B) (Defn of Power Set) Since this chain of equivalences holds for all X ∈U, it follows by the definition of set equality that P(A) ∩P(B) = P(A ∩B). 65\n\n Proving Set Equality via Logical Equivalences To prove A = B: 1.

Induction 67\n\n 10. September 17 10.1. Principle of Mathematical Induction Previously, we discussed proving universal statements by showing that a proposition holds for an arbitrary element of the set in question. However, for universal statements of the form For every integer n ≥M, P(n) is true, there is another technique known as the principle of mathematical induction that is often more effective. To introduce this principle, we first recall our working definition of N. This definition captures the essential structure of the natural numbers without going into the deeper foundations of set theory. Definition (Working Definition). The set of natural numbers N is the “smallest” set I such that 0 ∈I and (∀k ∈I, k + 1 ∈I). That is, let I be any set such that 0 ∈I and whenever k ∈I, then also k + 1 ∈I. Define F = {X ⊆I | 0 ∈X ∧∀k ∈I, (k ∈X →k + 1 ∈X)}. Then N = \\ X∈F X. Remark. Other, more formal approaches to defining the natural numbers exist. The Peano axioms characterize N through logical rules, while in set theory (ZFC) one can construct N explicitly from the axioms. We will not use these approaches in this course, but a brief sketch of the set-theoretic construction is provided in Appendix A. From this working definition of N, we immediately obtain the following result, which justifies the method of proof by induction. 68\n\n Theorem 10.1.1 (Principle of Mathematical Induction). Let P(n) be a statement about n ∈N. If 1. P(0) is true, and 2. for all k ∈N, if P(k) is true then P(k + 1) is true, then P(n) is true for all n ∈N. As an analogy, consider an infinite line of equally spaced dominoes representing the natural numbers, as shown below. The assumptions of the Principle of Mathematical Induction can be interpreted as follows: 1. The first domino falls over. 2. If one domino falls over, then the next domino will fall over. From this, we can conclude that any given domino will eventually fall over. That is, if we let P(n) be the predicate “The nth domino falls over,” then we can conclude ∀n ∈N, P(n) holds true. Note. Both conditions are essential in order to conclude that an arbitrary domino will eventually fall over. We will now prove the Principle of Mathematical Induction from the definition of N. Proof. Let P(n) be a predicate defined on n ∈N such that: 1. P(0) holds, and 2. ∀k ∈N, (P(k) →P(k + 1)) holds. Define a set S ⊆N as follows: S = {n ∈N | P(n)}. We wish to show that S = N. Since S ⊆N by definition, it suffices to show that N ⊆S. By assumption (1), P(0) holds, so 0 ∈S. By assumption (2), S is closed under the successor function: for all k ∈N, if k ∈S, then k + 1 ∈S. Thus, S contains 0 and is 69\n\n closed under successors. By the definition of N as the smallest set with these properties, it follows that N ⊆S. Therefore, S = N by double containment. Hence, P(n) holds for all n ∈N. While this proof appears to require induction starting at n = 0, the following corollary shows that we may begin at any integer M. Corollary 10.1.2 (Corollary to PMI). Let M ∈Z and S = {z ∈Z | z ≥M}. Further, let P(n) be a predicate defined on S such that 1. P(M) holds 2. ∀k ∈S, (P(k) →P(k + 1)) holds Then ∀n ∈S, P(n) holds. Proof. Let P(n) be as above, and define a new predicate Q(n) on n ∈N by Q(n) ⇔P(n + M) From (1), P(M) holds, so Q(0) holds. Now assume Q(k) holds for some k ∈N. Then P(k + M) holds. Since k + M ∈S, assumption (2) implies P(k + M + 1) holds, hence Q(k + 1) holds. Thus, Q(n) satisfies the two conditions of induction. By PMI, Q(n) holds for all n ∈N. Finally, let n ∈S be arbitrary. Then n−M ∈N, so Q(n−M) holds. By definition of Q, this means P(n) holds. Since n ∈S was arbitrary, we conclude ∀n ∈S, P(n) holds. PMI Template Let M ∈Z and S = {n ∈Z | n ≥M}. Claim: ∀n ∈S, P(n) is true. Proof : We proceed by induction on n ∈S. • Base Case: n = M. Prove that P(M) holds. • Inductive Hypothesis: Assume n ∈S and P(n) holds. • Inductive Step: Use the assumption that P(n) holds to prove that P(n + 1) holds. By the principle of mathematical induction, ∀n ∈S, P(n) holds. Before we move on to our first example, let us make a couple of notes on summations and products. Statements involving summations and products are often proved by induction, since both are defined recursively. 70\n\n • For n ∈Z+, the sum of real numbers a1, a2, . . . , an, denoted Pn i=1 ai, is defined recursively as follows: ▶ 0P i=1 ai = 0 ▶ n+1 P i=1 ai = \u0012 nP i=1 ai \u0013 + an+1 For example: 4 X i=1 (i2 + 1) = (12 + 1) + (22 + 1) + (32 + 1) + (42 + 1) = 34 • For n ∈Z+, the product of real numbers a1, a2, . . . , an, denoted Qn i=1 ai, is defined recursively as follows: ▶ 0Q i=1 ai = 1 ▶ n+1 Q i=1 ai = \u0012 nQ i=1 ai \u0013 · an+1 For example: 4 Y i=1 (i2 + 1) = (12 + 1) · (22 + 1) · (32 + 1) · (42 + 1) = 1700 10.1.1. Examples We are now ready to begin working through examples. Example 10.1.3. For n ∈Z+, the nth triangular number, Tn, is defined as the sum of the first n consecutive positive integers. That is, Tn = n X i=1 i = 1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + n. We would like to find a closed-form expression for Tn. First, let us compute a few examples to look for a pattern: • T1 = 1 • T2 = 1 + 2 = 3 • T3 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 = 4 + 2 71\n\n • T4 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 = 5 + 5 • T5 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 = 6 + 6 + 3 • T6 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21 = 7 + 7 + 7 • T100 = 1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + 100 = 101 + · · · + 101 | {z } 50 times • T101 = 1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + 101 = 102 + · · · + 102 | {z } 50 times +51 These suggest the following observations: • If n is even, we can pair terms so that each pair sums to n + 1. Since there are n 2 such pairs, n X i=1 i = (n + 1) \u0010n 2 \u0011 = n(n + 1) 2 . • If n is odd, we can again pair terms so that each pair sums to n + 1, leaving the middle term n + 1 2 unpaired. Therefore, n X i=1 i = (n + 1) \u0012n −1 2 \u0013 + n + 1 2 = n(n + 1) 2 . In both cases, we obtain the same closed-form expression. This motivates the following proposition. Claim: For all n ∈Z+, n X i=1 i = n(n + 1) 2 . Proof. We proceed by induction on n ∈Z+. • Base Case: For n = 1, 1 X i=1 i = 1 = 1(1 + 1) 2 . Thus the base case holds. • Inductive Step: Assume for some k ∈Z+ that k X i=1 i = k(k + 1) 2 . (This is the inductive hypothesis.) 72\n\n We must show k+1 X i=1 i = (k + 1)(k + 2) 2 . Observe the following chain of equalities: k+1 X i=1 i = k X i=1 i ! + (k + 1) = k(k + 1) 2 + (k + 1) (by the inductive hypothesis) = k(k + 1) + 2(k + 1) 2 = (k + 1)(k + 2) 2 . By the Principle of Mathematical Induction, it follows that n X i=1 i = n(n + 1) 2 for all n ∈Z+.", "output": "Consider using mathematical induction.

We will consider the sum of consecutive *odd* integers. Let’s draw some pictures and make some observations. If we keep adding consecutive odd numbers, will we always get a square? It sure looks like it, but a preponderance of evidence is not sufficient justification. It’s possible that this pattern falls apart for some larger values of n. However, from our geometric description, we can see that using our observation that 1 block makes a 1×1 square, we showed that 1+3 blocks make a 2×2 square. From there, we were able to show that 1+3+5 blocks can form a 3 × 3 square. Since we used the previous case being true to show that the next case is true, this seems to lend itself to induction. Claim: For all n ∈Z+, nP i=1 (2i −1) = n2. Proof. We proceed by induction on n ∈Z+. • Base Case: If n = 1, then 1 X i=1 (2i −1) = 1 = 12, as desired. • Inductive Step: Let k ∈Z+ and assume kP i=1 (2i −1) = k2 (this is our Inductive Hypothesis). Then we have the following chain of equalities: 74\n\n k+1 X i=1 (2i −1) = k X i=1 (2i −1) ! + (2(k + 1) −1) = k X i=1 (2i −1) ! + (2k + 1) = k2 + 2k + 1 (by the Inductive Hypothesis) = (k + 1)2. Hence, k+1 P i=1 (2i −1) = (k + 1)2, as desired. By the principle of mathematical induction, we conclude that nP i=1 (2i −1) = n2 for all n ∈Z+. 11.1.2. Sequences Definition. A sequence of real numbers is an enumerated collection of reals in which repetition and order matter. For now, we focus on sequences of real numbers, typically enumerated by either N or Z+. Notation: ⟨an⟩n∈N represents the sequence ⟨an⟩n∈N = ⟨a0, a1, a2, a3, . . .⟩, where each ai is a real number. a0 is the 0th term, a1 is the 1st term, etc. Similarly, ⟨an⟩n∈Z+ = ⟨a1, a2, a3, . . .⟩. More formally, a sequence can be thought of as a function f : N →R. We have not yet studied functions formally, so for now we treat this as an intuition. Often, sequences are defined recursively, which makes them particularly well-suited for proofs by induction. For example, recall the triangular numbers, ⟨Tn⟩n∈Z+, defined by Tn = 1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + n. We can also define this sequence recursively by specifying the initial term (the base case) and how each subsequent term is derived from the previous one (the recurrence relation): T1 = 1, Tn+1 = Tn + (n + 1). In this section, we will introduce two important sequences. 75\n\n The Factorial Sequence Definition. For n ∈N, we define n!, read “n factorial,” by n! = n Y i=1 i. Since product notation is itself defined recursively, this definition can also be rewritten as follows: 0! = 1 (n + 1)! = (n + 1) · n! For example, 5! = 5 · 4 · 3 · 2 · 1 = 120. Now let us look at an induction proof involving the factorial sequence. Example 11.1.2. For which values of n ∈N does the inequality n! > 2n hold? To answer this, we first examine small values of n: n 2n n! 0 1 1 1 2 1 2 4 2 3 8 6 4 16 24 5 32 120 6 64 720 From this table, we see that at n = 4, n! first exceeds 2n. Moreover, it appears that n! continues to grow faster than 2n thereafter. This suggests the following conjecture. Claim: For all integers n ≥4, we have n! > 2n. Proof. We proceed by induction on n ∈N with n ≥4. • Base Case: When n = 4, we compute 4! = 24 > 16 = 24, as required. 76\n\n • Inductive Step: Let k ∈N with k ≥4 and assume k! > 2k. We want to show (k + 1)! > 2k+1. Using the recursive definition of factorial, we compute: (k + 1)! = (k + 1) · k! (By Definition) > (k + 1) · 2k (By the Inductive Hypothesis) > 2 · 2k (Since k ≥4) = 2k+1. Thus, (k + 1)! > 2k+1, as desired. By the principle of mathematical induction, we conclude that n! > 2n for all integers n ≥4. Note. Notice that our proof did not address the values n = 0, 1, 2, 3, since the claim only concerned n ≥4. To check what happens at those smaller values, we had to verify them directly using the table. The induction proof neither proves nor disproves the inequality for n < 4; it simply establishes the result for all n ≥4.", "output": "Consider using mathematical induction.

The first several Fibonacci numbers are: ⟨fn⟩n∈N = ⟨0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, . . .⟩. Example 11.1.4. Prove that fn < 2n for all n ∈N. Problem: In order to prove that the claim holds for fn+1, we will need to refer not only to fn but also to fn−1. How can we handle this situation using the principle of mathematical induction? 77\n\n 11.1.3. Strong Induction Theorem 11.1.5 (Strong Principle of Mathematical Induction). Let P(n) be a predicate defined for all n ∈N. Suppose: 1. P(0) holds. 2. ∀k ∈N, ((∀i ∈[k] ∪{0}, P(i)) →P(k + 1)) holds. Then P(n) holds for all n ∈N. In other words, if P(0) is true and whenever P(0), P(1), . . . , P(n) are all true this implies P(n + 1) is true, then P(n) is true for all n ∈N. We will now prove the Strong Principle of Mathematical Induction using the ordinary Principle of Mathematical Induction. Proof. Let P(n) be a predicate defined for all n ∈N, satisfying conditions (1) and (2) of the theorem. Define a new proposition Q(n) for n ∈N by Q(n) := ∀i ∈[n] ∪{0}, P(i). We proceed by induction on n ∈N to show that Q(n) holds for all n ∈N. • Base Case: n = 0. By assumption (1), P(0) holds. By the definition of Q(n), we have Q(0) ≡P(0). Thus Q(0) holds. • Inductive Step: Let k ∈N and assume Q(k) holds (this is the inductive hypothesis). From the definition of Q(k), this means ∀i ∈[k] ∪{0}, P(i) holds. By condition (2), it follows that P(k + 1) holds. Therefore, ∀i ∈[k + 1] ∪{0}, P(i) holds, so Q(k + 1) holds. By the principle of mathematical induction, Q(n) holds for all n ∈N. Finally, to see that this implies ∀n ∈N, P(n): let n ∈N. Since Q(n) holds, we have ∀i ∈[n] ∪{0}, P(i). Because n ∈[n] ∪{0}, it follows that P(n) holds. Since n was arbitrary, ∀n ∈N, P(n) holds.", "output": "Consider using mathematical induction.

Proof : We proceed by strong induction on n ∈S. Base Case: Show P(M) holds because . . . There may be more base cases if necessary. Inductive Step: Let k ∈S such that P(i) holds for all i ∈S with M ≤i ≤k. Show P(k + 1) holds. If there are ℓmany base cases, assume k ≥M + ℓ. By the strong principle of mathematical induction, we conclude that ∀n ∈S, P(n) holds. Notice that in the template we allow for multiple base cases, even though the theorem itself does not explicitly mention this. Multiple base cases arise when the truth of P(k + 1) is completely independent of the truth of P(0), P(1), . . . , P(k), so there is no causality linking these earlier terms to P(k+1). In such situations, we must verify the first several values directly. Eventually, however, the sequence becomes causal, meaning that each term depends on previous ones, at which point strong induction can be applied. Before returning to Example 11.1.4, we will first examine the historically significant induction problem that necessitated the use of the strong inductive hypothesis. To do so, we first need to formally define a prime number. Definition. • A natural number n is called prime if and only if n > 1 and its only positive divisors are 1 and n. • A natural number n is called composite if and only if n > 1 and n is not prime. That is, there exists a, b ∈N with 1 < a ≤b < n such that n = ab. For instance, the first 10 prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29 79\n\n In the chapter on number theory, we will discuss prime numbers in much more depth. For now, the important idea is that prime numbers are the basic building blocks of the natural numbers (and, in fact, the integers as well). Our first strong induction proof is the first half of an important result in number theory, the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Theorem 11.1.7 (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, Part 1). For all n ∈N with n > 1, n is either prime or a product of primes. Proof. We proceed by strong induction on the integers n ≥2. Define P(n) to be the proposition that “n is either prime or a product of primes.” • Base Case: n = 2. The number 2 is prime since the only possible positive divisors are 1 and 2, which both divide 2. Thus, P(2) holds. • Inductive Step: Let k ∈N with k ≥2 and assume P(i) holds for all i ∈N with 2 ≤i ≤k. Consider n = k + 1. We break this into two cases: ▶Case 1: If k + 1 is prime, then P(k + 1) holds, as desired. ▶Case 2: If k + 1 is not prime, then there exist p, q ∈N with 2 ≤p ≤q ≤k such that k + 1 = pq. Fix such p and q. By the inductive hypothesis, both p and q are either prime or a product of primes. Thus, for some a, b ∈Z+, p = a Y i=1 pi, q = b Y j=1 qj where the pi’s and qj’s are primes. Therefore, k + 1 = a Y i=1 pi !  b Y j=1 qj  , which shows that k + 1 is a product of primes. Hence P(k + 1) holds. By the strong principle of mathematical induction, P(n) holds for all integers n ≥2. 80\n\n 12. September 24 12.1. Principle of Mathematical Induction 12.1.1. Strong Induction To see another variety of a strong induction proof, let us now revisit Example 11.1.4. Example 12.1.1. Claim: For all n ∈N, fn < 2n. We will have two base cases for this proof for two reasons. First, f0 and f1 are defined independently of the previous terms, so the truth value of fn < 2n will need to be manually verified for these terms. Secondly, since fn is defined in terms of the previous two terms for n ≥2, we will need to know that the inequality holds for two consecutive terms in order to apply the (strong) inductive hypothesis. Proof. We proceed by strong induction on n ∈N. • Base Cases: We verify that the inequality holds for n = 0 and n = 1. ▶n = 0. f0 = 0 < 1 = 20, as desired. ▶n = 1. f1 = 1 < 2 = 21, as desired. • Inductive Step: Let k ∈N with k ≥1, and assume that fi < 2i for all i ∈Z with 0 ≤i ≤k. We want to show fk+1 < 2k+1. fk+1 = fk + fk−1 (by definition, since k + 1 ≥2) < 2k + 2k−1 (by IH) = 2k−1(2 + 1) = 2k−1 · 3 < 2k−1 · 22 = 2k+1 Therefore, fk+1 < 2k+1, as desired. By the strong principle of mathematical induction, we conclude that fn < 2n for all n ∈N. 81\n\n Note. In our first strong induction example, it was necessary to assume that P(i) held for all 2 ≤i ≤k in order to conclude that P(k + 1) holds. In this example, however, it was enough to assume that P(k −1) and P(k) hold in order to prove P(k +1). The standard strong induction hypothesis is sufficient here, but you could alternatively rephrase the inductive hypothesis to match the specific assumptions actually used in the proof. For instance: Let k ∈N with k ≥1 such that fk < 2k and fk−1 < 2k−1. We want to show that fk+1 < 2k+1. Notice that, thanks to our two base cases, this hypothesis is valid when k = 1. From there, we can conclude that P(2) holds, then P(3) holds, and so on. SPMI With Multiple Base Cases Let M ∈Z and define S = {n ∈Z | n ≥M}. Claim: ∀n ∈S, P(n). Proof : We proceed by strong induction on n ∈S. Base Cases: Prove P(M), P(M + 1), . . . , P(M + s) hold. Inductive Step: Let k ∈Z with k ≥M + s and assume P(i) holds for all i ∈Z with M ≤i ≤k. Show P(k + 1) holds. By the strong principle of mathematical induction, we conclude that ∀n ∈S, P(n) holds.", "output": "Consider using mathematical induction.

Prove that for all n ∈N, the following equality holds. n X k=1 f2k = f2n+1 −1 There is one more important consequence of the Principle of Mathematical Induction (actually logically equivalent to PMI) which we will discuss. 12.1.2. Well-Ordered Sets Definition. Let X be a set ordered by <. X is called well-ordered if and only if every nonempty subset has a least element. In future lectures, we will discuss how to construct other orderings of sets, but for now, we will be referring just to our standard < ordering on R and its subsets. Examples 12.1.5. Some examples of well-ordered sets (ordered by <): 1. N 2. {x ∈Z | x ≥−100} 3. nn 2 | n ∈N o 4. {2n | n ∈N} Non-Examples 12.1.6. Plenty of sets are not well-ordered under the standard < ordering. If there exists a nonempty subset with no least element, then the set is not well-ordered. For instance, 1. Z 2. R 3. [0, 1) 4. {2n | n ∈Z} Well-ordered sets are important with regard to mathematical induction. Every set that we have inducted on so far has been a well-ordered subset of Z, although we haven’t proven that yet. This is a consequence of the following theorem, which also will give us a new variation on mathematical induction. Theorem 12.1.7 (Well-Ordering Property). N is well-ordered by <. Proof. Let P(n) be the predicate “every subset of N containing n has a least element.” We will prove P(n) holds for all n ∈N by strong induction. Base Case: n = 0. Since 0 is the least natural number, any subset of N containing 0 has a least element. Thus P(0) holds. 83\n\n Inductive Step: Let k ∈N and assume P(i) holds for all natural numbers i with 0 ≤i ≤k. Now consider n = k + 1, and let S ⊆N with k + 1 ∈S. • If S has no element less than k + 1, then k + 1 is the least element in S. • If S contains an element i ≤k, then by inductive hypothesis, we know P(i) holds. Hence S has a least element. Since these are the only two possibilities, P(k + 1) holds. By the strong principle of mathematical induction, P(n) holds for all n ∈N. Since any nonempty subset S ⊆N must contain some n ∈N, we conclude that N is well-ordered. There was nothing special about starting at 0 in N. We therefore have the following corollary. Corollary 12.1.8. For M ∈Z, if S = {x ∈Z | x ≥M}, then S is well-ordered. We’ll see two main uses for the Well-Ordering Property. WOP as Part of a Larger Proof In number theory and other fields of discrete mathematics, it is common to use the Well-Ordering Property (the existence of a least element satisfying the proposition) as a step in a larger proof. We’ll use it here to finally complete the proof of the Division Algorithm. Theorem 12.1.9 (Division Algorithm). Let a, b ∈Z with b > 0. Then there exist unique q, r ∈Z such that a = bq + r with 0 ≤r < b. We have already shown that if such q and r exist, then they are unique (see the proof of Theorem 3.1.1). It remains to show that q and r always exist. Existence. Define S ⊆N as follows: S = {n ∈N | ∃k ∈Z, (n = a −bk)}. For any integer k ≤a b, we have a −bk ≥0, so S ̸= ∅. By the Well-Ordering Property, there exists a least element r ∈S. Fix r. Then, by definition of S, we have r = a −bq for some q ∈Z. Fix q as well. We want to show that these are our desired values of q and r from the statement of the theorem. Since r ∈S ⊆N, we know r ≥0. It remains to show that r < b. 84\n\n Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that r ≥b. Then r−b ≥0. Substituting r = a−bq, we compute: r −b = a −bq −b = a −b(q + 1) ≥0. This implies that r −b ∈S, contradicting our assumption that r was the least element of S. Hence, a = bq + r with 0 ≤r < b. Therefore, there exist q, r ∈Z such that a = bq + r with 0 ≤r < b, as desired. 85\n\n 13. September 26 13.1. Principle of Mathematical Induction 13.1.1. Well-Ordered Sets Proof by Infinite Descent The other major application of the Well-Ordering Property is a variant of induction known as a proof by infinite descent. One consequence of the Well-Ordering Property is that there is no infinite descending sequence of natural numbers. In a proof by infinite descent, we assume, for the sake of contradiction, that the claim fails for some n ∈N. We then show that it must also fail for a smaller value m ∈N. Iterating this process would yield an infinite descending sequence of natural numbers, contradicting the Well-Ordering Property. There are many different ways of phrasing infinite descent arguments, but below we present one outline of how such a proof may proceed. Template for Infinite Descent Proofs Claim: ∀n ∈N, P(n) Proof : Assume for the sake of contradiction (AFSOC) that ∃n ∈N such that ¬P(n) holds. Let n ∈N be the least natural number such that ¬P(n) holds (which exists by the WOP). Show that ∃k ∈N with k < n such that ¬P(k) holds. This contradicts our assumption. Therefore, by the Well-Ordering Property, ∀n ∈N, P(n) holds. Example 13.1.1. Claim: √ 2 is irrational. Proof. To prove that √ 2 is irrational, it suffices to show that √ 2 ̸= m n for all m, n ∈Z+. Define the predicate P(n) on n ∈Z+ by P(n) := ∀m ∈Z+, ( √ 2 ̸= m n ). 86\n\n Our goal is to show that ∀n ∈Z+, P(n) holds. Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that ∃n ∈Z+ such that ¬P(n) holds. Fix n ∈Z+ as the least such that ¬P(n) holds, which exists by the Well-Ordering Property. Since ¬P(n) holds, there exists m ∈Z+ such that √ 2 = m n . Fix such an m. Squaring both sides of the equation and rearranging gives 2n2 = m2. Thus m2 is even. By Proposition 7.1.1, m is even, so m = 2m′ for some m′ ∈Z+. Fix m′. Substituting back, we obtain 2n2 = 4(m′)2 ⇒ n2 = 2(m′)2. This implies n2 is even, and hence n is even. Therefore n = 2n′ for some n′ ∈Z+. Fix n′. Since n = 2n′ and n′ < n, we have found a smaller denominator. Substituting back, we get √ 2 = m n = 2m′ 2n′ = m′ n′ . Thus ¬P(n′) holds, contradicting the minimality of n. Therefore, our assumption was false, and P(n) holds for all n ∈Z+. Hence √ 2 is irrational.", "output": "Consider using mathematical induction.

Binary Relations In this section, we will explore the concept of a binary relation between two sets (often just called a relation). The idea of a relation between two sets is already familiar to you. A binary relation allows us to compare or link elements from two sets. For instance, when we say 2 < 3, we are comparing two elements from Z. Similarly, when we say “Bill takes a class with Professor Johnson,” we are linking an element from the set of students with an element from the set of professors. We formalize this idea by defining a binary relation as a subset of the Cartesian product of the two sets being linked. Definition. Let S and T be sets. • If R ⊆S ×T, then R is called a binary relation between S and T. If (a, b) ∈R, we say that “a is in relation to b,” sometimes denoted aRb. • S is called the domain of R, and T is called the codomain of R. Many of the common relations in mathematics (and in other contexts) are relations where both elements belong to the same set (i.e., S = T). In that case, we simply say that R is a relation on S, meaning that R ⊆S × S. We begin by examining examples of binary relations, some linking elements of different sets, and others connecting elements of the same set. Examples 14.1.1. 1. Let S be the set of students at CMU and T be the set of professors at CMU. We define a relation R ⊆S × T such that (s, t) ∈R if and only if s has taken a class with t. That is, R = {(s, t) ∈S × T | s has taken a class with t}. For any given pair (s, t) of student and professor, we can determine whether s has taken a class with t by checking if (s, t) ∈R. 89\n\n 2. The standard ordering relation < is a relation on sets such as R, Q, Z, and N. We can express this comparison as a set of ordered pairs. For instance, for x, y ∈R, we have x < y iff (x, y) ∈{(a, b) ∈R2 | ∃c ∈R+, (a + c = b)}. 3. The divisibility relation on the integers is another common example. Recall that for m, n ∈Z, we say that m | n if and only if there exists k ∈Z such that m·k = n. This relation can be viewed as the set of ordered pairs Rd: Rd = {(m, n) ∈Z2 | ∃k ∈Z, (m · k = n)}. 4. The subset relation ⊆is another familiar example. Let S be a set. We define the binary relation of ⊆on P(S) (the power set of S) such that for any A, B ∈P(S), the following holds: A ⊆B iff ∀x ∈S, (x ∈A →x ∈B). We can also express this relation as the set of ordered pairs, Rs: Rs = {(A, B) ∈P(S) × P(S) | ∀x ∈S, (x ∈A →x ∈B)}. 5. Functions are another important type of binary relation. For instance, the function f(x) = x2, defined for x ∈R, is a relation that links elements of R with other elements of R. The function f can be represented as the set of ordered pairs in R2 that satisfy the condition y = x2. In other words, the function f is given by: f = {(x, y) ∈R2 | y = x2}. This set is commonly referred to as the graph of f. 6. Equality is perhaps the most common binary relation on any set. For any set S, equality can be expressed as the set of ordered pairs for which the first and second components are identical: Re = {(a, a) ∈S × S | a ∈S}.", "output": "Think about what proof technique would work best here: direct proof, contrapositive, or contradiction?", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

(b) What is the binary relation on S with the fewest number of elements? (c) What is the binary relation on S with the most number of elements? 90\n\n 14.2. Functions Recall how a function was first introduced to you in earlier courses. Was it presented as a “rule” mapping elements from one set to another? Was it defined as a curve in R2 that passes the vertical line test? What if there is no explicit rule for defining the mapping? Must a function be something that we can graph in R2? Formally, a function is a relation that is more general than these definitions. Definition. Let A and B be sets, and let f be a binary relation between A and B. We say that f is a function from A to B, denoted f : A →B, if and only if for each a ∈A, there exists a unique b ∈B such that (a, b) ∈f. Notation: We write f(a) = b to mean that (a, b) ∈f. Recall that for any relation R ⊆A × B, we say that A is the domain of R and B is the codomain of R. This terminology is most commonly used when f is a function. If f : A →B is a function, then A is the domain of f and B is the codomain of f. Examples 14.2.1. 1. Let S be any set. We define the identity function on S, denoted IdS or simply Id if the domain is clear from context, by IdS : S →S such that for all x ∈S, IdS(x) = x. That is, the identity function maps each element to itself. Equivalently, we can write IdS as the set of ordered pairs: IdS = {(x, x) | x ∈S}. 2. Define the function f : R+ →R by f(x) = √x for any x ∈R+. Then f is a function and can be expressed formally as: f = {(a, b) ∈R+ × R | a = b2 ∧b > 0}. 3. Let A = {x, y, z}. Define g : A →N by: g = {(x, 1), (y, 10), (z, 42)}. Note that there is no requirement for a specific pattern in the mapping, even if the domain is infinite. We do not need to explicitly write a rule defining the mapping for it to be a function. We simply need to ensure that for each a ∈A, there is a unique b ∈B such that (a, b) ∈g. 91\n\n Non-Examples 14.2.2. The following proposed “functions” are ill-defined: 1. Suppose you define a mapping f : R →R by f(x) = 1 x. f is not defined over the entire domain. In particular, f(0) is undefined. 2. Suppose you define a mapping g : N →N by g(n) = √n. While g(n) is defined for each n ∈N, the output does not always belong to the codomain N. For example, g(2) = √ 2 /∈N. 3. Suppose you define a mapping h : Q →Z by h \u0010 p q \u0011 = p + q. h is not well-defined because it fails to satisfy the uniqueness condition. For instance, 1 2 = 2 4, but h \u0000 1 2 \u0001 = 3 while h \u0000 2 4 \u0001 = 6. 92\n\n 15. September 29 15.1. Functions As seen in the previous non-examples, we can be given a rule for a mapping f : A →B, and it may not be clear whether or not it is a function. For this reason, we introduce the terminology of a well-defined function. A well-defined function is simply a binary relation that satisfies the definition of a function. However, it is worth emphasizing this point, as we are often given “rules” for mappings rather than explicit sets of ordered pairs. Definition. A mapping f : A →B is a well-defined function iff f satisfies the following conditions: 1. (Totality) For all a ∈A, f(a) is defined. (That is, A is the domain of f.) 2.

{"instruction": "Give me a hint for solving the following problem.", "input": "Prove the above theorem. The important point is that two functions are considered equal not based on how they are defined, but on their behavior: they must yield the same output for every element in the domain, regardless of how their rules are expressed. Example 15.1.4. Let A = {1, 2, 3}. Define f : A →Z by f(x) = x3 −x2 −6 and g : A →Z by g(x) = 5x2 −11x. At first glance, f and g seem to be different functions because they have different defining expressions. However, since A has only three elements, we can manually verify that f and g give the same output for every element in A: f = {(1, −6), (2, −2), (3, 12)} = g Therefore, f and g are indeed equal despite their differing rules. You may have noticed that we have not used the word “range” when discussing functions. This is because the term “range” can be ambiguous: some use it to mean the codomain (the set of potential outputs), while others use it to mean the set of actual outputs. To avoid this ambiguity, we will not use the term “range.” Instead, we use the term image when referring to the set of actual outputs, as defined below. 15.1.1. Images and Preimages Definition. Let A and B be sets, and let f : A →B be a function. For any subset X ⊆A, the image of X under f, denoted by Imf(X), is defined as: Imf(X) = {b ∈B | ∃a ∈X, (f(a) = b)} . If X = A, we refer to this as the image of f. 94\n\n Note. The image of any subset X ⊆A under f is always a subset of the codomain B. That is, for any X ⊆A, we have Imf(X) ⊆B. Example 15.1.5. Let f : R →R be defined by f(x) = x2. Then: Imf(R) = [0, ∞), Imf({−2, 1, 2}) = {1, 4}. Let’s now see how to use the definition of images in a proof. Proposition 15.1.6. Let A and B be sets, and let f : A →B be a function. For any S, T ∈P(A), we have Imf(S ∩T) ⊆Imf(S) ∩Imf(T) Proof. Let y ∈Imf(S ∩T) be arbitrary. By the definition of the image, there exists some x ∈S ∩T such that f(x) = y. Fix such an x. By the definition of intersection, we have x ∈S and x ∈T. Since y = f(x) and x ∈S, it follows that y ∈Imf(S). Similarly, since x ∈T, we also have y ∈Imf(T). Thus, y ∈Imf(S) ∩Imf(T), as desired. Since y was arbitrary, we conclude that Imf(S ∩T) ⊆Imf(S) ∩Imf(T).", "output": "Think about what proof technique would work best here: direct proof, contrapositive, or contradiction?", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}
{"instruction": "Give me a hint for solving the following problem.", "input": "Show that the reverse containment does not always hold. Similar to the definition of an image, we have the concept of a preimage (also called the inverse image). The image of a set is the set of outputs corresponding to inputs from the original set. Similarly, the preimage of a subset of the codomain is the set of inputs that yield those outputs (if any). We formalize this idea below. Definition. Let A and B be sets, and let f : A →B be a function. For any subset Y ⊆B, the preimage of Y under f, denoted PreImf(Y ), is defined as: PreImf(Y ) = {a ∈A | f(a) ∈Y } Note. Since A is the domain of f, it always holds that PreImf(B) = A. Example 15.1.8. Consider again the function f : R →R defined by f(x) = x2.

Let A and B be sets, and let f : A →B be a function. We say that f is injective (or one-to-one) if and only if for all x, y ∈A, if f(x) = f(y), then x = y. 96\n\n Standard Injectivity Proof Outline • Let x, y ∈A such that f(x) = f(y). • Use the definition of f and other assumptions to show that x = y. • Conclude that f is injective. Let’s begin with a simple example to illustrate this concept. Example 15.1.12. Define f : R →R by f(x) = 5x + 6. Prove that f is an injection. Proof. Let x, y ∈R such that f(x) = f(y). Then: 5x + 6 = 5y + 6. Subtracting 6 from both sides, we get 5x = 5y. Dividing both sides by 5 gives: x = y. Therefore, f is injective. In early algebra courses, we often say that a function f : R →R is injective if and only if it “passes the horizontal line test.” This means that any horizontal line drawn in the Cartesian plane will intersect the graph of the function at most once. In the case of the function f(x) = 5x + 6, the graph passes the horizontal line test, as shown on the right. A function fails the horizontal line test if there are two distinct values of x that correspond to the same value of y. 97\n\n 16. October 1 16.1. Functions 16.1.1. Jections Injections We now look at a function where the definition splits into two cases depending on whether the input is positive or not. Example 16.1.1. Define a function f : Z →N by f(n) = ( 2n −1 if n > 0, −2n if n ≤0. Claim: f is injective. Proof. Let x, y ∈Z such that f(x) = f(y). We will consider three cases: (1) both x and y are positive, (2) both x and y are nonpositive, and (3) one is positive and the other is non-positive. • Case 1: Suppose x, y > 0. In this case, f(x) = f(y) implies 2x −1 = 2y −1. By adding 1 to both sides, we get 2x = 2y, and dividing by 2, we obtain x = y. • Case 2: Suppose x, y ≤0. Here, f(x) = f(y) implies −2x = −2y. Dividing both sides by −2, we get x = y. • Case 3: Without loss of generality, assume x > 0 and y ≤0. Then, f(x) = f(y) implies 2x −1 = −2y. Rearranging this, we have 2x + 2y = 1, or equivalently, x + y = 1 2. However, x + y ∈Z, while 1 2 /∈Z, a contradiction. Hence, this case is not possible. Since in all cases we either have x = y or a contradiction, we conclude that f(x) = f(y) implies x = y for all x, y ∈Z. Therefore, f is injective. Remark. It is important not to forget the third case where one input is positive and the other is non-positive. Although it might feel like the first two cases should cover 98\n\n everything, the mixed case is precisely where we need to argue that no equality is possible. Without this check, the proof would be incomplete. Disproving Injectivity To show that a function f : A →B is not injective, it is enough to find distinct elements x, y ∈A such that f(x) = f(y). This kind of argument is usually a simple proof by demonstration. Example 16.1.2. As a contrast, let us examine a function that fails to be injective. Define f : Z2 →Z by f(x, y) = x + y. Claim: f is not an injection. Proof. Consider (0, 0), (1, −1) ∈Z2. Since (0, 0) ̸= (1, −1) but f(0, 0) = 0 = f(1, −1), we have found two distinct inputs with the same output. Therefore f is not an injection.", "output": "Think about what proof technique would work best here: direct proof, contrapositive, or contradiction?", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

Surjections Definition. Let A and B be sets, and let f : A →B be a function. We say f is surjective (or onto) if and only if Imf(A) = B. That is, ∀b ∈B, ∃a ∈A such that f(a) = b. 99\n\n Standard Surjectivity Proof Outline • Let b ∈B be arbitrary and fixed. • Show that there exists a ∈A such that f(a) = b. (This is often done by explicitly constructing such an a.) • Conclude that f is surjective. Notice that surjectivity focuses on whether every element of the codomain is “hit” by the function. As a first illustration, let’s revisit the function from Example 16.1.2. Although it failed to be injective, we will see that it is surjective. Example 16.1.4. Define f : Z2 →Z by f(m, n) = m + n. Claim: f is a surjection. Proof. Let y ∈Z be arbitrary. We want to show that there exists (m, n) ∈Z2 such that f(m, n) = y. Consider (y, 0) ∈Z2. Then f(y, 0) = y + 0 = y. Since y was arbitrary, this proves that f is surjective. Example 16.1.5. Let f : Q →Q be defined by f(x) = 1 + 2x. Claim: f is a surjection. Proof. Let y ∈Q. Then y = m n for some m, n ∈Z with n ̸= 0. Fix such m and n. To find x such that f(x) = y, we need to solve 1 + 2x = m n . Rearranging the equation, we get x = m −n 2n . Since m and n are integers with n ̸= 0, it follows that x = m −n 2n ∈Q. Then f \u0012m −n 2n \u0013 = 1 + 2 · m −n 2n = 1 + m −n n = n + (m −n) n = m n = y. Since y ∈Q was arbitrary, we conclude that f is surjective. Next, let us revisit the function from Example 16.1.1. Earlier we showed it was injective; here we will prove that it is also surjective. This means the function actually turns out to be a bijection, though we will make that terminology precise later. 100\n\n Example 16.1.6. Define a function f : Z →N by f(n) = ( 2n −1 if n > 0, −2n if n ≤0. Claim: f is a surjection. Proof. Let y ∈N be arbitrary. We consider two cases: when y is even and when y is odd. • Case 1: Suppose y is even. Then y = 2k for some k ∈N. Consider x = −k. Since −k ≤0, we have f(x) = f(−k) = −2(−k) = 2k = y. • Case 2: Suppose y is odd. Then y = 2k+1 for some k ∈N. Consider x = k+1 ∈Z. Since k + 1 > 0, we have f(x) = f(k + 1) = 2(k + 1) −1 = 2k + 1 = y. Since we have addressed both possibilities, we conclude that f is surjective. Disproving Surjectivity A function f : A →B is not surjective if and only if there exists an element b ∈B such that f(a) ̸= b for all a ∈A. In other words, to disprove surjectivity it suffices to find a single element in the codomain that is not in the image of f. Example 16.1.7. Let f : R →R be defined by f(x) = x+|x| 2 . Claim: f is not a surjection. Proof. Consider y = −1 ∈R. Assume for the sake of contradiction that there exists x ∈R such that f(x) = −1. Then: x + |x| 2 = −1. We consider two cases based on the value of x: • Case 1: Suppose x ≥0. Then |x|= x, and the equation becomes x + x 2 = −1 =⇒2x 2 = −1 =⇒x = −1. But this contradicts our assumption that x ≥0. 101\n\n • Case 2: Suppose x < 0. Then |x|= −x, and the equation becomes x −x 2 = −1 =⇒0 2 = −1 =⇒0 = −1, which is a contradiction. Since both cases lead to a contradiction, there is no x ∈R such that f(x) = −1.

Bijections Definition. Let A and B be sets, and let f : A →B be a function. We say that f is a bijection if and only if f is both an injection and a surjection. We have already encountered some examples of bijections, though we did not explicitly call them that at the time. Example 16.1.9. Define f : Z →N by f(n) = ( 2n −1 if n > 0, −2n if n ≤0. Recall from Example 16.1.1 that we proved f is injective, and from Example 16.1.6 that f is surjective. Therefore, f is a bijection. 102\n\n Example 16.1.10. Define f : R →R by f(x) = 5x+6. In Example 15.1.12, we showed that f is injective. It remains to verify that f is surjective. Proof. Let y ∈R be arbitrary. Consider x = y −6 5 ∈R. Then f \u0012y −6 5 \u0013 = 5 \u0012y −6 5 \u0013 + 6 = y. Therefore, f maps onto all of R, proving that f is surjective. Since f is both injective and surjective, it follows that f is a bijection. In both examples, we established bijectivity by separately proving injectivity and surjectivity. This two-part process is the standard way to show that a function is a bijection. We now formalize it into a general strategy. Proving Bijectivity – Method 1 To prove that a function f : X →Y is a bijection, you need to: • Prove that f is an injection (i.e., for all x1, x2 ∈X, if f(x1) = f(x2) then x1 = x2). • Prove that f is a surjection (i.e., for every y ∈Y , there exists x ∈X such that f(x) = y). Example 16.1.11. Define f : R →R by f(x) =    1 x −1, if x < 1, √x −1, if x ≥1. Claim: f is a bijection. Proof. We will prove that f is both injective and surjective. • Injectivity: Let x1, x2 ∈R such that f(x1) = f(x2). We consider three cases: Case 1: Assume x1, x2 < 1. Then 1 x1 −1 = 1 x2 −1. Rearranging gives x1 −1 = x2 −1, so x1 = x2, as required. Case 2: Assume x1, x2 ≥1. Then √ x1 −1 = √ x2 −1. Squaring both sides yields x1 −1 = x2 −1, so x1 = x2. 103\n\n Case 3: Without loss of generality, assume x1 < 1 and x2 ≥1. Then f(x1) = 1 x1 −1 < 0, f(x2) = √ x2 −1 ≥0. Since a negative number cannot equal a nonnegative number, this contradicts the assumption that f(x1) = f(x2). Since all cases either forced x1 = x2 or led to a contradiction, we conclude that f is injective. • Surjectivity: Let y ∈R. We want to show there exists x ∈R such that f(x) = y. We split into two cases: Case 1: Suppose y < 0. Define x = 1 y + 1. Since y ̸= 0 and y < 0, it follows that x < 1. Then f(x) = f \u00121 y + 1 \u0013 = 1 1 y + 1 −1 = 1 1 y = y. Case 2: Suppose y ≥0. Define x = y2 + 1. Since y2 ≥0, we have x ≥1. Then f(x) = f(y2 + 1) = p y2 + 1 −1 = p y2 = |y|= y, where the last equality holds because y ≥0. In both cases, we have found an x ∈R such that f(x) = y. Therefore, f is surjective. Since f is both injective and surjective, we conclude that f is a bijection. Because f : R →R is a bijection, this is also visible in its graph: every horizontal line intersects the graph at exactly one point, confirming both injectivity and surjectivity.

Composition and Inverses of Functions Before introducing a second method for proving bijectivity, we first need to define the operation of composing functions. Definition. Let A, B, and C be sets, and let f : A →B and g : B →C be functions. The composition of g and f is the function h : A →C defined by h(a) = g(f(a)) for all a ∈A. We denote this by h = g ◦f. An important property of function composition is that it is associative. Theorem 16.1.13 (Associativity of Composition). Let A, B, C, and D be sets, and let f : A →B, g : B →C, and h : C →D be functions. Then h ◦(g ◦f) = (h ◦g) ◦f. Proof. Let a ∈A. Then (h ◦(g ◦f))(a) = h((g ◦f)(a)) = h(g(f(a))) = (h ◦g)(f(a)) = ((h ◦g) ◦f)(a). Since a ∈A was arbitrary, we conclude that h ◦(g ◦f) = (h ◦g) ◦f. Note. Let f : A →B. Then IdB ◦f = f and f ◦IdA = f. In particular, if f : A →A, then IdA ◦f = f ◦IdA = f. This shows that the identity function is the identity element under the binary operation of composition. 105\n\n 17. October 3 17.1. Functions 17.1.1. Composition and Inverses of Functions The following theorem summarizes key properties of function composition with respect to injections, surjections, and bijections. Theorem 17.1.1. Let A, B, and C be sets, and let f : A →B and g : B →C be functions. Then the following properties hold: 1 If f and g are injections, then g ◦f : A →C is also an injection. 2 If f and g are surjections, then g ◦f : A →C is also a surjection. 3 If f and g are bijections, then g ◦f : A →C is also a bijection. Proof. 1 Assume that f : A →B and g : B →C are injections. We will show that g ◦f : A →C is injective. Let a1, a2 ∈A such that (g ◦f)(a1) = (g ◦f)(a2). By the definition of composition, this gives: g(f(a1)) = g(f(a2)). Since g is injective, we conclude: f(a1) = f(a2). And since f is injective, it follows that a1 = a2. Therefore, g ◦f is injective. 2 The proof that g ◦f is surjective is left as an exercise for recitation. 3 Since g ◦f is both injective (by 1 ) and surjective (by 2 ), it is bijective. 106\n\n Inverses Now that we have defined function composition, we can introduce the concept of inverse functions and prove an important result about bijections. Definition. Let A and B be sets, and let f : A →B and g : B →A be functions. • g is called a left inverse of f if and only if g ◦f = IdA. • g is called a right inverse of f if and only if f ◦g = IdB. • g is called a (two-sided) inverse of f if and only if g is both a left and a right inverse. • f is invertible if and only if f has a two-sided inverse. Notation: If f is invertible, we denote its inverse function by f−1. While not every function is invertible, an important property of inverses is that if they exist, they are unique. Theorem 17.1.2 (Uniqueness of Inverses). Let A and B be sets, and let f : A →B be a function. If f is invertible, then its inverse function f−1 is unique. Proof. Let f : A →B be invertible. Suppose g : B →A and g′ : B →A are both inverses of f. We want to show that g = g′. Since g and g′ are inverses of f, we know: f ◦g = IdB, g ◦f = IdA, f ◦g′ = IdB, g′ ◦f = IdA. Let b ∈B be arbitrary. Then g(b) = (g ◦IdB)(b) = (g ◦(f ◦g′))(b) = ((g ◦f) ◦g′)(b) = (IdA ◦g′)(b) = g′(b). Thus, g(b) = g′(b) for all b ∈B, which shows g = g′. Therefore, the inverse of f is unique. We now establish our major result for this section. Theorem 17.1.3. Let A and B be sets, and let f : A →B be a function. Then f is invertible if and only if f is a bijection. Proof. 107\n\n (⇒): Suppose f is invertible. Then there exists a function g : B →A such that g ◦f = IdA and f ◦g = IdB. We show that f is a bijection. ▶Injective: Let a1, a2 ∈A with f(a1) = f(a2). Applying g to both sides gives g(f(a1)) = g(f(a2)). Since g ◦f = IdA, it follows that idA(a1) = IdA(a2) =⇒ a1 = a2. Hence f is injective. ▶Surjective: Let b ∈B be arbitrary. Define a = g(b) ∈A. Since f and g are inverses, we have f(a) = f(g(b)) = IdB(b) = b. Hence f is surjective. Thus f is both injective and surjective, so f is a bijection. (⇐): Suppose f is a bijection (i.e., injective and surjective). Define the relation g = {(b, a) ∈B × A | f(a) = b}. We show g is a function from B to A. Let b ∈B. Since f is surjective, there exists a ∈A such that f(a) = b, so (b, a) ∈g. To show uniqueness, suppose (b, a), (b, a′) ∈g. Then f(a) = b = f(a′). Since f is injective, a = a′. Thus each b ∈B corresponds to a unique a ∈A, so g is a function. By construction, f ◦g = IdB and g ◦f = IdA. Hence g is the inverse of f, so f is invertible. From this theorem, we obtain a second method for proving bijectivity. Proving Bijectivity – Method 2 To prove that f : A →B is a bijection, it suffices to show that f is invertible. • Construct the inverse function g : B →A and prove that it is well-defined. • Prove that f ◦g = IdB. • Prove that g ◦f = IdA. • Conclude that g = f−1 and hence f is a bijection. 108\n\n Note. This method is best suited to functions defined by simple rules (where one can easily solve for x in terms of f(x)). For more complicated functions (especially piecewise ones), it is typically clearer to prove injectivity and surjectivity directly. Example 17.1.4. Let S = R ∖{3} and T = R ∖{1}. Define f : S →T by f(x) = x −2 x −3. Prove that f is a bijection. Scratch work: y = x −2 x −3 =⇒xy −3y = x −2 =⇒x(y −1) = 3y −2 =⇒x = 3y −2 y −1 . Proof. Define g : T →S by g(x) = 3x −2 x −1 . We will show that g is the inverse of f. • Well-Definedness: Since x ̸= 1 for all x ∈T, the expression 3x −2 x −1 is defined. If x1 = x2, then clearly 3x1 −2 x1 −1 = 3x2 −2 x2 −1 , so g(x1) = g(x2). To check that g(x) ∈S, we verify that g(x) ̸= 3 for all x ∈T: g(x) = 3 ⇐⇒ 3x −2 x −1 = 3 ⇐⇒ 3x −2 = 3x −3 ⇐⇒ −2 = −3, a contradiction.

Homogeneous Relations Now that we’ve explored functions as a special type of binary relation, we turn our attention to relations where the domain and codomain are the same set. These are called homogeneous relations. Such relations are especially important because many of the most familiar mathematical structures, such as orderings and equivalence relations, are defined in terms of simple properties like reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity. By studying these properties in isolation, we will see how they combine to give rise to these richer and more structured types of relations. Definition. Let R be a binary relation on a set S. Then R is called: • Reflexive iff ∀x ∈S, (x, x) ∈R (i.e., every element is related to itself). • Irreflexive iff ∀x ∈S, (x, x) /∈R (i.e., no element is related to itself). • Symmetric iff ∀x, y ∈S, ((x, y) ∈R →(y, x) ∈R). • Antisymmetric iff ∀x, y ∈S, (((x, y) ∈R ∧(y, x) ∈R) →x = y). • Transitive iff ∀x, y, z ∈S, (((x, y) ∈R ∧(y, z) ∈R) →(x, z) ∈R). • Total iff ∀x, y ∈S, (x ̸= y →((x, y) ∈R ∨(y, x) ∈R)) (i.e., any two distinct elements are comparable). Notes. • Irreflexivity vs. Reflexivity: Irreflexivity is not the opposite of reflexivity. Both are universal statements. The only time a relation can be both reflexive and irreflexive is when the set S is empty. However, many relations are neither reflexive nor irreflexive. • Symmetry vs. Antisymmetry: Antisymmetry is not the opposite of symmetry. These properties are not logical negations of one another. The only relations that are both symmetric and antisymmetric are subsets of the equality relation. However, many relations are neither symmetric nor antisymmetric. • Contrapositive in Antisymmetry: In some cases, the hypothesis of antisymmetry (both (x, y) and (y, x) being in R) may never hold. In such cases, it is useful 111\n\n to consider the contrapositive: if x ̸= y, then either (x, y) /∈R or (y, x) /∈R. Below we examine several common binary relations and determine whether they satisfy these properties. Set Relation Refl. Irrefl. Symm. Antisymm. Trans.

Equivalence Relations In previous math courses, you may have encountered situations where objects that are distinct in one context are considered equivalent in another. For example, angles such as 0◦, 360◦, and 720◦differ numerically, but they represent the same direction when drawn on a circle. Similarly, in geometry, two similar triangles are often treated as equivalent because they share the same angles, even if their side lengths differ. These examples highlight how, depending on the context, certain differences are ignored and objects are regarded as “essentially the same.” 112\n\n Definition. A relation R on a set S is called an equivalence relation if and only if R is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. Equivalence relations arise in many mathematical contexts. Here are some common examples: 1. Equality on any set. 2. Similarity of triangles: △A ∼△B if and only if they have the same interior angles. 3. Rounding real numbers to the nearest integer: two real numbers x and y are equivalent if they round to the same nearest integer. x ∼y ⇐⇒∃n ∈Z such that x, y ∈ \u0014 n −1 2, n + 1 2 \u0013 . 4. Logical equivalence in propositional logic. 5. Parity on Z: two integers a and b are equivalent if and only if they have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd). One of the most commonly used equivalence relations in mathematics and computer science is congruence modulo m on the integers. We now give the formal definition of this relation. Definition. Let m ∈Z+. For any a, b ∈Z, we say that a is congruent to b modulo m, denoted a ≡b (mod m), if and only if m | (a −b). Theorem 18.1.3. For any m ∈Z+, congruence modulo m is an equivalence relation on Z. Proof. Let m ∈Z+. We will show that congruence modulo m is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. • (Reflexivity): Let a ∈Z. We want to show that a ≡a (mod m). Since a −a = 0 = m · 0, we have m | (a −a), and thus a ≡a (mod m), as desired. • (Symmetry): Let a, b ∈Z with a ≡b (mod m). We want to show that b ≡a (mod m). Since a ≡b (mod m), we have m | (a −b), meaning a −b = mk for some k ∈Z. It follows that b −a = m(−k), which implies m | (b −a) because −k ∈Z. Therefore, b ≡a (mod m), as desired. 113\n\n • (Transitivity): Let a, b, c ∈Z such that a ≡b (mod m) and b ≡c (mod m). We want to show that a ≡c (mod m). From a ≡b (mod m), we have a −b = mk for some k ∈Z. From b ≡c (mod m), we have b −c = mℓfor some ℓ∈Z. Summing these equations gives: a −c = (a −b) + (b −c) = mk + mℓ= m(k + ℓ) Thus m | (a −c), and therefore a ≡c (mod m). Since congruence modulo m is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive, it follows that it is an equivalence relation on Z. Congruence modulo m is often used to describe sets with cyclic structure. Even if you have not encountered the terminology before, you have almost certainly used the idea. Here are some familiar examples: • Days of the week: The days repeat every 7 days. For instance, if 25 days ago was a Monday, then today is a Friday because 25 ≡4 (mod 7), meaning it is 4 days past a Monday. • Clocks: Converting between 24-hour and 12-hour time uses congruence modulo 12. For example, 16 : 00 satisfies 16 ≡4 (mod 12), so the time is 4:00 PM in 12-hour notation. • Parity: Odd and even integers can be described using congruence modulo 2. We have a ≡b (mod 2) if and only if a −b is even, meaning a and b have the same parity. • Angles: Angles measured in degrees can be treated using congruence modulo 360. For example, 375 ≡15 (mod 360), so 375◦and 15◦are coterminal. To get a handle on this equivalence relation, let’s consider the case of m = 3. A few quick observations about which integers are or are not congruent to one another: • 26 ≡2 (mod 3) because 3 | (26 −2) • 0 ≡3 (mod 3) because 3 | (0 −3) • 7 ̸≡21 (mod 3) because 3 ∤(7 −21) 114\n\n 19. October 8 19.1. Homogeneous Relations 19.1.1. Equivalence Classes The purpose of defining an equivalence relation is to identify the underlying structure of equality in order to generalize it to other contexts. Since an equivalence relation defines a new notion of two elements being the same, it is useful to discuss sets of elements that are all considered the same as each other. Below, we make precise this idea of being the same. Definition. Let R be an equivalence relation on a set S. For every x ∈S, we define the equivalence class of x under R, denoted [x]R, by [x]R = {y ∈S | (x, y) ∈R} That is, [x]R is the collection of all elements that are equivalent to x, under the specific notion of equivalence being discussed. The set of all equivalence classes is referred to as the quotient set, denoted S/R, read “S modulo R”. That is S/R = {[x]R | x ∈S} Because congruence modulo m is a commonly used equivalence relation, the set of equivalence classes (commonly called congruence classes in this context) has a special notation. Special Notation For m ∈Z+, the set S/R of congruence classes modulo m is denoted by Z/mZ. This set contains m equivalence classes: Z/mZ = {[0]m, [1]m, [2]m, . . . , [m −1]m}. We often write integers as if they were their equivalence classes, viewing Z/mZ as a cycle of m distinct classes. 115\n\n Example 19.1.1. Consider congruence modulo 3 on Z. What do the equivalence classes look like? [0]3 = {x ∈Z | 3 | (x −0)} = {x ∈Z | ∃k ∈Z, (x = 3k)} = {. . . , −3, 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, . . .} [1]3 = {x ∈Z | 3 | (x −1)} = {x ∈Z | ∃k ∈Z, (x = 3k + 1)} = {. . . , −5, −2, 1, 4, 7, . . .} [2]3 = {x ∈Z | 3 | (x −2)} = {x ∈Z | ∃k ∈Z, (x = 3k + 2)} = {. . . , −4, −1, 2, 5, 8, . . .} [3]3 = {x ∈Z | 3 | (x −3)} = {x ∈Z | 3 | x} = [0]3 [4]3 = {x ∈Z | 3 | (x −4)} = {x ∈Z | 3 | (x −1)} = [1]3 [5]3 = {x ∈Z | 3 | (x −5)} = {x ∈Z | 3 | (x −2)} = [2]3 We should also look at some equivalence classes for negative integers: [−1]3 = {x ∈Z | 3 | (x + 1)} = {x ∈Z | 3 | (x −2)} = [2]3 [−2]3 = {x ∈Z | 3 | (x + 2)} = {x ∈Z | 3 | (x −1)} = [1]3 [−3]3 = {x ∈Z | 3 | (x + 3)} = {x ∈Z | 3 | x} = [0]3 Let’s make a few observations about these equivalence classes and how they relate to our original set, Z. • There are 3 distinct equivalence classes: [0]3, [1]3, and [2]3. • Each equivalence class is an infinite set of integers. • The union of the equivalence classes gives the entire set: [0]3 ∪[1]3 ∪[2]3 = Z. • The equivalence classes are pairwise disjoint. • We have S/R = Z/3Z = {[0]3, [1]3, [2]3}.

The Fundamental Theorem of Equivalence Relations In the previous example of Z/3Z, the congruence classes modulo 3 formed what we call a partition of Z. Definition. Let S be a set, I be an index set, and Ai ⊆S for each i ∈I. Then {Ai | i ∈I} is called a partition of S if and only if: 1. For each i ∈I, Ai ̸= ∅. 2. For each i, j ∈I, either Ai = Aj or Ai ∩Aj = ∅. 3. S i∈I Ai = S. That is, {Ai | i ∈I} is a partition of S if and only if the Ai’s divide S into nonempty, non-overlapping pieces. Figure 19.2.: An illustration of a partition of a set. Returning to Example 19.1.1, we see that Z/3Z = {[0]3, [1]3, [2]3} satisfies the three properties of a partition: 1. Each congruence class in Z/3Z is a nonempty subset of the integers. 117\n\n 2. Any two congruence classes in Z/3Z are either equal to each other or disjoint from each other. 3. The union of the three distinct congruence classes in Z/3Z is all of Z. It is not a coincidence that Z/3Z is a partition of Z. In fact, this phenomenon holds for all equivalence relations (and conversely), as the following theorem states. Theorem 19.1.3 (Fundamental Theorem of Equivalence Relations). Let S be a nonempty set. Then the following hold: 1. If R is an equivalence relation on S, then S/R is a partition of S. 2. If F is a partition of S, then there exists an equivalence relation R on S such that S/R = F. Before proving this theorem (or at least one direction of it—we’ll leave the other for homework), let’s look at a concrete example of the reverse direction. We’ve already seen how an equivalence relation produces a partition; now we’ll see how a partition gives rise to an equivalence relation. Example 19.1.4. Let S = [6] and F = {{1}, {2, 5, 6}, {3, 4}} be a partition of S. We want to find an equivalence relation R on S such that S/R = F. Define R ⊆S × S by declaring two elements related if they belong to the same block of the partition. Explicitly, R = {(1, 1), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 2), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 2), (6, 5), (6, 6)}. We can manually check that R is an equivalence relation on S. • (R): Is (x, x) ∈R for each x ∈[6]? ✓ • (S): For each (x, y) ∈R, is (y, x) ∈R also? ✓ • (T): For each (x, y), (y, z) ∈R, is (x, z) ∈R also? ✓ So, R is an equivalence relation on S, and S/R has 3 distinct equivalence classes. [1]R = {1}, [2]R = [5]R = [6]R = {2, 5, 6}, [3]R = [4]R = {3, 4}. Thus, the set of equivalence classes is exactly the given partition: S/R = {[1]R, [2]R, [3]R} = F. We now proceed to prove the theorem. 118\n\n Proof. 1. Homework 2. Let F = {Si}i∈I be a partition of S. Define a relation R on S by R = {(x, y) ∈S | ∃i ∈I, (x ∈Si ∧y ∈Si)}. We want to show that R is an equivalence relation and that S/R = F. First, we check reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity. • (R): Let x ∈S. Since F is a partition of S, we have S i∈I Si = S. Hence, x ∈Si for some i ∈I, by the definition of an indexed union. Fix such an i. Then x ∈Si implies that (x, x) ∈R, as desired. • (S): Let x, y ∈S such that (x, y) ∈R. Then, by definition of R, we have x ∈ Si ∧y ∈Si for some i ∈I. Fix such an i. Since conjunction is commutative, this implies y ∈Si ∧x ∈Si. Hence (y, x) ∈R, as desired. • (T): Let x, y, z ∈S such that (x, y), (y, z) ∈R. Then, by definition of R, there exists i ∈I such that x ∈Si ∧y ∈Si, and there exists j ∈I such that y ∈Sj ∧z ∈Sj. Fix such i and j. Since F is a partition of S and y ∈Si and y ∈Sj, it must be the case that Si = Sj (the pieces of a partition are either equal or disjoint). Thus, x ∈Si ∧z ∈Si, implying that (x, z) ∈R, as desired. Therefore, R is an equivalence relation on S. It remains to show S/R = F. We proceed by double containment. • (⊆): Let A ∈S/R. Then, by definition, A = [x]R for some x ∈S. Since F is a partition, x belongs to exactly one block Si ∈F. Then A = [x]R = {y ∈S | y ∈Si} = Si. Therefore, A ∈F, as desired. • (⊇): Let Si ∈F. Since F is a partition, Si ̸= ∅. Fix x ∈Si. By uniqueness of the partition blocks, Si is the only block of F containing x. Thus [x]R = {y ∈S | y ∈Si} = Si, so Si ∈S/R. By double containment, we conclude that S/R = F. The utility of equivalence relations extends beyond classification: they provide the foundation for many mathematical structures, such as quotient groups in group theory and partitions in topology. Recognizing and applying these concepts will deepen your understanding of advanced mathematics and the connections between its different areas. 119\n\n 19.1.3. (Optional) Formal Constructions of Z and Q Previously, we discussed how to construct the natural numbers (or a structure having the same properties as N) from the axioms of set theory. Now, with the power of equivalence relations, we can formally construct the integers and rational numbers. This approach allows us to define addition and multiplication on these sets in a way that is consistent with the operations we already take for granted. Constructing the Integers The natural numbers do not include additive inverses, so subtraction is not always possible within N. To address this, we will construct the integers by introducing formal differences. The guiding idea is that an ordered pair (a, b) ∈N2 represents the “formal difference” a −b. However, we must be careful: since subtraction is not defined in N, we cannot simply say (a, b) = (c, d) whenever a −b = c −d. Instead, we use the following property of N: Cancellation Law: If k + m = n + m then k = n. This motivates the following definition. Theorem 19.1.5. Define a relation ∼on N2 by (a, b) ∼(c, d) ⇐⇒ a + d = b + c. Then ∼is an equivalence relation on N2. Proof. To be completed in recitation. The quotient set N2/∼will represent our set of integers. Each equivalence class [(a, b)]∼ under this relation represents the integer corresponding to the formal difference a −b. For example, [(3, 1)]∼ represents 3 −1 = 2, [(2, 5)]∼ represents 2 −5 = −3. We now want to define addition and multiplication on N2/∼in a way that matches how these operations behave in Z. For instance, we want 2 + (−3) to correspond to [(3, 1)]∼+ [(2, 5)]∼, and the result should represent −1. Similarly, 2 · (−3) should correspond to [(3, 1)]∼· [(2, 5)]∼, 120\n\n and the result should represent −6. Motivated by these examples, we define our operations as follows. Definition. We define addition on N2/∼by [(a, b)]∼+ [(c, d)]∼= [(a + c, b + d)]∼, and multiplication by [(a, b)]∼· [(c, d)]∼= [(ac + bd, ad + bc)]∼. Recall that equivalence classes can be represented by multiple ordered pairs. For example, [(2, 0)]∼= [(3, 1)]∼= [(4, 2)]∼= · · · Our definitions above used specific representatives, so we must verify that the operations are well-defined. That is, the result does not depend on the choice of representative. Theorem 19.1.6. The operations defined above are well-defined. In particular, if (a, b) ∼(a′, b′) and (c, d) ∼(c′, d′), then: 1. (a + c, b + d) ∼(a′ + c′, b′ + d′), 2. (ac + bd, ad + bc) ∼(a′c′ + b′d′, a′d′ + b′c′). Equivalently, if [(a, b)]∼= [(a′, b′)]∼and [(c, d)]∼= [(c′, d′)]∼, then [(a, b)]∼+[(c, d)]∼= [(a′, b′)]∼+[(c′, d′)]∼ and [(a, b)]∼·[(c, d)]∼= [(a′, b′)]∼·[(c′, d′)]∼. Before proving this theorem, let’s explore an example. Example 19.1.7. Suppose we want to represent the sum 2 + 3. Using our definition of addition, we could write: [(2, 0)]∼+ [(3, 0)]∼= [(2 + 3, 0 + 0)]∼= [(5, 0)]∼, which represents the number 5, as expected. But we could also represent 2 and 3 differently: [(3, 1)]∼+ [(10, 7)]∼= [(3 + 10, 1 + 7)]∼= [(13, 8)]∼, which also represents the number 5. Our theorem states that no matter which representatives of 2 and 3 we choose, the sum will always represent 5. Similarly, for the product 2 · 3 = 6: [(2, 0)]∼· [(3, 0)]∼= [(6 + 0, 0 + 0)]∼= [(6, 0)]∼ 121\n\n represents 6, while [(3, 1)]∼· [(10, 7)]∼= [(30 + 7, 21 + 10)]∼= [(37, 31)]∼ also represents 6. This illustrates that multiplication, too, should be independent of the choice of representatives. We now proceed to prove the theorem. Proof. Let (a, b), (a′, b′), (c, d), (c′, d′) ∈N2 such that (a, b) ∼(a′, b′) and (c, d) ∼(c′, d′). 1. We want to show that (a + c, b + d) ∼(a′ + c′, b′ + d′). By assumption, a + b′ = b + a′ and c + d′ = d + c′. Adding these two equalities gives a + c + b′ + d′ = b + d + a′ + c′, which shows (a + c, b + d) ∼(a′ + c′, b′ + d′). Thus, addition is well-defined on Z. 2. We want to show that (ac + bd, ad + bc) ∼(a′c′ + b′d′, a′d′ + b′c′). As in the previous case, from our assumptions we have a + b′ = b + a′ and c + d′ = d + c′. Multiplying the first equality by c and d, and the second by a′ and b′, we obtain c(a + b′) = c(b + a′), d(a + b′) = d(b + a′), and a′(c + d′) = a′(d + c′), b′(c + d′) = b′(d + c′). Adding these four equalities together yields c(a+b′)+d(a+b′)+a′(c+d′)+b′(c+d′) = c(b+a′)+d(b+a′)+a′(d+c′)+b′(d+c′). Expanding both sides gives ac+bd+a′d′ +b′c′ +b′c+a′d+a′c+b′d = ad+bc+a′c′ +b′d′ +a′c+b′d+a′d+b′c. Cancelling the common terms on both sides, we are left with ac + bd + a′d′ + b′c′ = ad + bc + a′c′ + b′d′. 122\n\n This is exactly the condition that (ac + bd, ad + bc) ∼(a′c′ + b′d′, a′d′ + b′c′), as desired. Therefore multiplication is well-defined on Z. Remark. With these definitions of addition and multiplication, the set Z inherits many of the familiar properties we expect integers to satisfy: associativity, commutativity, distributivity, and the existence of additive identities and inverses. These follow from the corresponding properties in N, but require careful checking in this new framework.", "output": "Think about what proof technique would work best here: direct proof, contrapositive, or contradiction?", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

Constructing the Rationals Now that we have a formal definition of the integers, we can follow a similar path to construct the rational numbers. The integers do not always include multiplicative inverses, so we cannot define division in Z. Let Z∗= Z ∖{0}. We will define a relation on (a, b), (c, d) ∈Z × Z∗that matches how we informally think of equality of fractions, a b = c d, but avoids direct use of division. We rely on the fact that the integers have no zero divisors: a · b = 0 ⇐⇒a = 0 or b = 0. This motivates our definition. 123\n\n Theorem 19.1.9. Define a relation ≃on Z × Z∗by (a, b) ≃(c, d) ⇐⇒ ad = bc. Then ≃is an equivalence relation on Z × Z∗. Proof. Homework 6. The quotient set Z × Z∗/≃will represent our set of rational numbers. Each equivalence class [(a, b)]≃under this relation represents the rational number corresponding to the quotient a b . For example, [(−1, 2)]≃ represents −1 2, [(8, 4)]≃ represents 8 4 = 2. We now define addition and multiplication on Z × Z∗/≃in a way consistent with how these operations behave in Q. For instance, we want −1 2 + 2 to correspond to [(−1, 2)]≃+ [(8, 4)]≃, and the result should represent 3 2. Similarly, −1 2 · 2 should correspond to [(−1, 2)]≃· [(8, 4)]≃, and the result should represent −1. Motivated by these examples, we define our operations as follows. Definition. We define addition on Z × Z∗/≃by [(a, b)]≃+ [(c, d)]≃= [(ad + bc, bd)]≃, and multiplication by [(a, b)]≃· [(c, d)]≃= [(ac, bd)]≃. Let’s revisit our previous example. Example 19.1.10. Suppose we want to take the sum and product of −1 2 and 2. Using the representatives from before and our formal definition of addition and multiplication, 124\n\n we have [(−1, 2)]≃+ [(8, 4)]≃= [(−4 + 16, 8)]≃= [(12, 8)]≃= 12 8 = 3 2, [(−1, 2)]≃· [(8, 4)]≃= [(−8, 8)]≃= −8 8 = −1. If instead we had chosen [(2, −4)]≃to represent −1 2 and [(2, 1)]≃to represent 2, we should still get the same answers: [(2, −4)]≃+ [(2, 1)]≃= [(2 −8, −4)]≃= [(−6, −4)]≃= −6 −4 = 3 2, [(2, −4)]≃· [(2, 1)]≃= [(4, −4)]≃= 4 −4 = −1. An example alone is not a proof, but it does indicate that these operations are probably well-defined, as this theorem confirms. Theorem 19.1.11. The operations defined above are well-defined. In particular, if (a, b) ≃(a′, b′) and (c, d) ≃(c′, d′), then 1. (ad + bc, bd) ≃(a′d′ + b′c′, b′d′), 2. (ac, bd) ≃(a′c′, b′d′). The proof of this theorem is similar to the analogous theorem for the integers.

Homogeneous Relations 20.1.1. Order Relations An order relation is a relation that ranks elements of a set against one another. Order relations generalize the familiar concepts of <, ≤, and ⊆. Definition. • A relation R on a set S is called a partial order if and only if R is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive. • If R is a partial order on S, then (S, R) is called a partially ordered set (or poset). For example, (P(S), ⊆) (for any set S) and (R, ≤) are posets. • A relation R is called a strict partial order if and only if R is irreflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive. For example, (P(S), ⊊) and (R, <) are strict partial orders. • A relation R is called a total order (or linear order) if and only if it is a partial order in which every pair of elements of S is comparable under R. As mentioned above, (P(S), ⊆) and (R, ≤) are two of the most common partial orders. The definition of a partial order can thus be viewed as a generalization of these familiar examples. Let’s begin by proving that ⊆is a partial order on a power set. Example 20.1.1. Consider the relation ⊆on P(N). We will prove that ⊆is a partial order on P(N). Proof. We must show that ⊆is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive. • (R): Let X ∈P(N). For every n ∈N, if n ∈X, then n ∈X, trivially. Thus X ⊆X. • (AS): Let X, Y ∈P(N) such that X ⊆Y and Y ⊆X. y the definition of set equality, this implies X = Y . 126\n\n • (T): Let X, Y, Z ∈P(N) such that X ⊆Y and Y ⊆Z. Let x ∈X. Since X ⊆Y , we have x ∈Y ; and since Y ⊆Z, we have x ∈Z. Therefore X ⊆Z. Hence, (P(N), ⊆) is a poset. The relation ⊆also motivates the term partial order: it provides a partial ranking of elements in P(N), but not all elements are comparable. For instance, {1} ̸⊆{2} and {2} ̸⊆{1}. A partial order in which all pairs of elements are comparable is called a total order (or linear order). A standard example of a total order is (R, ≤), and a standard example of a strict total order is (R, <). By contrast, ⊆serves as the canonical example of a partial order that is not total. Example 20.1.2. Consider the set N2. How can we linearly order the elements of this set? A natural first attempt might be to define (a, b) ≺(c, d) iff a < c and b < d. However, while this defines a strict partial order, it fails to satisfy totality. For instance, (1, 2) ̸≺(2, 1) and (2, 1) ̸≺(1, 2). Instead, we can order the elements of N2 in the same way we alphabetize words: by comparing the first components and, if they are equal, comparing the second components. This is known as the lexicographic ordering of N2. (a, b) ≺(c, d) iff (a < c) ∨((a = c) ∧(b < d)). Claim. The relation ≺is a strict total order on N2. Proof. We show that ≺is irreflexive, antisymmetric, transitive, and total. • (IR): Let (a, b) ∈N2. Since neither a < a nor b < b holds, we have (a, b) ̸≺(a, b). • (AS): We will prove the contrapositive of the definition of antisymmetry. Let (a, b), (c, d) ∈N2 such that (a, b) ̸= (c, d). We want to show (a, b) ̸≺(c, d) or (c, d) ̸≺(a, b). Since (a, b) ̸= (c, d), either a ̸= c or b ̸= d. We consider the cases of a = c and a ̸= c. ▶Case 1: a ̸= c. Without loss of generality, we may assume that a < c. Then (c, d) ̸≺(a, b) since c ̸< a. ▶Case 2: a = c. Since (a, b) ̸= (c, d) and a = c, it must be the case that b ̸= d. Without loss of generality, we may assume that b < d. Then (c, d) ̸≺(a, b) since c = a but d ̸< b. 127\n\n Since these are the only two cases, we conclude that ≺is antisymmetric. • (TR): Let (a, b), (c, d), (e, f) ∈N2 such that (a, b) ≺(c, d) and (c, d) ≺(e, f). We must show that (a, b) ≺(e, f). From (a, b) ≺(c, d), we have a < c or (a = c ∧b < d); from (c, d) ≺(e, f), we have c < e or (c = e ∧d < f). Consider cases: ▶Case 1: a < e. Then (a, b) ≺(e, f) by definition. ▶Case 2: a = e. Then it must be the case that a = c = e. Since (a, b) ≺(c, d) and a = c, we have b < d. Similarly, since (c, d) ≺(e, f) and c = e, we have d < f. Therefore, since b < d and d < f, we have b < f. Thus, (a, b) ≺(e, f), as desired. Therefore ≺is transitive. • (TO): Let (a, b), (c, d) ∈N2 with (a, b) ̸= (c, d). Then either a ̸= c or b ̸= d. ▶If a ̸= c, then either a < c or c < a. In the first case (a, b) ≺(c, d), and in the second (c, d) ≺(a, b). ▶If a = c and b ̸= d, then either b < d or d < b. In the first case (a, b) ≺(c, d), and in the second (c, d) ≺(a, b). Hence every pair is comparable, so ≺is total. Therefore, (N2, ≺) is a strict total order.", "output": "Think about what proof technique would work best here: direct proof, contrapositive, or contradiction?", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

Introduction Informally, the cardinality of a set S, denoted |S|, is the number of elements in the set. For finite sets, this definition is straightforward. However, for infinite sets, it is not immediately clear how we can define the notion of two infinite sets having the same cardinality. Below are some initial questions we might consider: 1 How should we compare the sizes of sets? 2 What does it mean for two sets to have the same size? 3 Should all infinite sets be considered the same size? To motivate our exploration of Questions 1 and 2 , let’s begin with a simpler case. Simpler Question: How can we determine whether two finite sets have the same size? One possible answer is to count the elements in each set. However, this approach breaks down when the sets are infinite. A more flexible method is to pair the elements of the two sets. If we can match each element of set A with exactly one element of set B, with no elements left unmatched in either set, then the two sets must contain the same number of elements. Example 21.1.1. Let A = {w, x, y, z} and B = {♡, ♢, ♣, ♠}. w ↔ ♡ x ↔ ♢ y ↔ ♣ z ↔ ♠ What we are actually doing here is defining a bijection f : A →B. This idea extends naturally to sets of any size and leads to our formal definition of “having the same cardinality.” 131\n\n Definition. Two sets A and B are said to have the same cardinality, or to be equinumerous, denoted |A|= |B|, if and only if there exists a bijection f : A →B. To better understand this definition, let’s look at some examples. Example 21.1.2. Let A = {a, b, c} and B = {d}. Since A has three elements while B has only one, it is clear that |A|̸= |B|. This can also be seen from the definition: any function f : A →B must map every element of A to d, which makes f non-injective. Therefore, no bijection can exist between A and B. Example 21.1.3. Let E be the set of even integers. The function f : Z →E defined by f(n) = 2n is a bijection. Hence, the set of even integers has the same cardinality as the set of all integers: |E|= |Z|. Example 21.1.4. Recall from Example 16.1.9 the function f : Z →N given by f(n) = ( 2n −1, if n > 0, −2n, if n ≤0. This function is a bijection, showing that |Z|= |N|. In other words, the integers and natural numbers have the same cardinality. Example 21.1.5. The function f : (0, 1) →(0, 2) defined by f(x) = 2x is a bijection. Thus, the number of real numbers in the interval (0, 1) is equal to the number in (0, 2); that is, |(0, 1)|= |(0, 2)|. Example 21.1.6. The function f : (0, 1) →R, defined by f(x) = ln \u0000 1−x x \u0001 , provides a bijection from (0, 1) to the entire real line. Therefore, |(0, 1)|= |R|: there are just as many real numbers in (0, 1) as there are in all of R. With these examples in mind, we will next focus on finite sets. Our goal will be to show that this formal definition of cardinality agrees with our intuitive understanding of “counting” elements. 21.2. Finite Sets We begin by formally defining what it means for a set to be finite or infinite. 132\n\n Definitions. • A set X is said to be finite iff there exists some n ∈N and a bijection f : [n] →X. In this case, we define the cardinality of X to be |X|= n. • A set X is said to be infinite iff it is not finite. That is, if no bijection exists between [n] and X for any n ∈N. Let’s look at a simple example to see how this definition corresponds with our everyday understanding of counting. Example 21.2.1. Consider the set A = {Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday}. By counting the days, we find that |A|= 7. This process of counting, or enumerating the elements, can be viewed as constructing a bijection f : [7] →A. For instance, if we list the days from left to right, we define f(1) = Su, f(2) = Mo, f(3) = Tu, f(4) = We, f(5) = Th, f(6) = Fr, f(7) = Sa. Alternatively, if we list the days in reverse order, we obtain another bijection g : [7] →A defined by g(1) = Sa, g(2) = Fr, g(3) = Th, g(4) = We, g(5) = Tu, g(6) = Mo, g(7) = Su. Both functions confirm that A is a finite set with cardinality 7. While the notation |X|= n suggests that this value of n is unique, we need to establish that rigorously. Specifically, we will show that there cannot be two distinct natural numbers m and n such that |X|= m and |X|= n. Theorem 21.2.2 (Injection Criterion for Finite Sets). For all m, n ∈N, there exists an injection f : [m] →[n] if and only if m ≤n. Proof. Let m, n ∈N. (⇐): Suppose m ≤n. Define f : [m] →[n] by f(x) = x. This function is well-defined since [m] ⊆[n], and it is clearly injective because distinct elements of [m] have distinct images under f. (⇒): We prove the contrapositive. Assume m > n, and let f : [m] →[n] be any function. For each i ∈[n], define Ai = PreImf({i}). 133\n\n Each element of [m] belongs to exactly one of the sets A1, A2, . . . , An, and different Ai’s have no elements in common. Since m > n, the pigeonhole principle implies that at least one of these sets, say Ai, contains two distinct elements m1 ̸= m2. Then f(m1) = f(m2) = i, so f is not injective. This theorem confirms that if a set X is finite, its cardinality is uniquely determined. Thus, the formal definition of finite cardinality agrees perfectly with our usual, intuitive notion of “counting” elements. Corollary 21.2.3. If X is a finite set, then there exists a unique n ∈N such that |X|= n. Proof. Let X be a finite set. Suppose, for contradiction, that there exist distinct m, n ∈ N such that |X|= m and |X|= n. Then there are bijections f : [n] →X and g : [m] →X. Without loss of generality, assume m > n. Consider the composition f−1 ◦g : [m] →[n]. This map is a bijection, since it is the composition of two bijections. In particular, it is an injection from the larger set [m] into the smaller set [n], contradicting the injection criterion established above. Therefore, it is impossible for two different values m and n to satisfy |X|= m = n. Hence, the value of n ∈N such that |X|= n is unique. A few additional corollaries are worth noting. Corollaries 21.2.4. 1. For all n ∈N, every subset of [n] is finite. 2. If f : A →B is an injection and B is finite, then |A|≤|B|. In particular, if A ⊆B, then |A|≤|B|. 3. If g : A →B is a surjection and A is finite, then |A|≥|B|. 4. If A is finite and B is any set, then |A ∩B|≤|A| and |A ∖B|≤|A|. Next, we mention two additional results concerning finite cardinality. The first pertains to the cardinality of Cartesian products, for which we will provide a formal proof in recitation. 134\n\n Theorem 21.2.5. If A and B are finite sets, then |A × B|= |A|·|B|. Proof. In recitation. The second result concerns the cardinality of unions. Before presenting the general theorem for determining |A ∪B|, we first need a lemma that addresses the case where the sets are disjoint. Lemma 21.2.6. If A and B are finite and disjoint sets, then |A ∪B|= |A|+|B|. Proof. Let A and B be finite and disjoint sets, and let |A|= m and |B|= n. Fix bijections f : [m] →A and g : [n] →B. Construct a function h : [m + n] →A ∪B by h(k) =    f(k), if 1 ≤k ≤m, g(k −m), if m + 1 ≤k ≤m + n. We will show that h is a bijection. • Injectivity. Let k1, k2 ∈[m + n] and suppose h(k1) = h(k2). ▶If both k1, k2 ≤m or both k1, k2 > m, then k1 = k2 since f and g are injective. ▶If k1 ≤m and k2 > m (or vice versa), then h(k1) ∈A and h(k2) ∈B, and hence h(k1) = h(k2) ∈A ∩B contradicting the assumption that A and B are disjoint. Hence h is injective. • Surjectivity: Let y ∈A ∪B. ▶Case 1: If y ∈A, then since f is surjective, there exists k ∈[m] such that f(k) = y. Thus h(k) = f(k) = y. ▶Case 2: If y ∈B, then since g is surjective, there exists ℓ∈[n] such that g(ℓ) = y. Then h(m + ℓ) = g(ℓ) = y. Therefore, h is surjective. Since h is both injective and surjective, it is a bijection. Hence |A ∪B|= m + n = |A|+|B|. The following theorem is a special case of a more general result we will discuss later in the combinatorics section, known as the Principle of Inclusion–Exclusion (PIE). 135\n\n Theorem 21.2.7 (PIE version 1). If A and B are finite sets, then |A ∪B|= |A|+|B|−|A ∩B|. Proof. Let A and B be finite sets. Observe that A ∪B = A ∪(B ∖A) and that A ∩(B ∖A) = ∅. By Lemma 21.2.6, |A ∪B|= |A|+|B ∖A|. Furthermore, since B = (B ∖A) ∪(B ∩A) and the two sets are disjoint, Lemma 21.2.6 also gives |B|= |B ∖A|+|B ∩A|. Rearranging, we have |B ∖A|= |B|−|B ∩A|. Substituting into the earlier expression yields |A ∪B|= |A|+|B|−|A ∩B|.", "output": "Consider using mathematical induction.

Basic Cardinality Comparisons There are various cardinalities of infinite sets, some of which may appear different in size but actually have the same cardinality. To illustrate this phenomenon, mathematician David Hilbert proposed the famous thought experiment known as Hilbert’s Hotel. 21.3.1. Hilbert’s Hotel Imagine a hotel with infinitely many rooms, enumerated by the natural numbers: 136\n\n Suppose all the rooms at Hilbert’s Hotel are currently occupied. Let’s explore how the hotel can still accommodate additional guests under various scenarios. 1. Suppose 1 new guest arrives. Can we find them a room? Even though all rooms are occupied, we can still accommodate the new guest. Instruct each current guest in room n to move to room n + 1. This frees up room 0, which can now be given to the new guest. This scenario demonstrates that |N ∪{−1}|= |N|. 2. Suppose an infinite number of new guests arrive, enumerated by N. Can we find rooms for them? Despite all rooms being occupied and an infinite number of new guests arriving, it is still possible to find rooms for everyone. Move each current guest in room n to room 2n. This leaves all odd-numbered rooms vacant, which can be assigned to the new guests. Specifically, place new guest m in room 2m + 1. This scenario illustrates that |{0, 1} × N|= |N|. 3. Suppose an infinite number of buses (enumerated by N), each containing an infinite number of guests (also enumerated by N), arrive. Can we find rooms for them? This situation is more challenging, since we now have infinitely many groups of infinitely many guests arriving while all rooms are still occupied. Surprisingly, we can still accommodate everyone by utilizing the fact that there are infinitely many prime numbers, and that for distinct primes p and q and integers k and ℓ, pk ̸= qℓ. Here’s how we proceed: 137\n\n • Move the current guest in room n to room 2n+1. Now, only rooms of the form 2k (for some k ∈Z+) are occupied, leaving all other rooms vacant. • For bus 0, assign new guest n to room 3n+1. • For bus 1, assign new guest n to room 5n+1. • In general, for bus m, assign new guest n to room pn+1 m+2, where pm+2 denotes the (m + 2)-nd prime number. • At this point, every guest has a room, and some rooms remain empty (e.g., rooms 1 and 6). Any room not of the form pk for some prime p and positive integer k is vacant. This scenario shows that |N2|≤|N|, since the room assignment defines an injection rather than a bijection. Recall: We previously constructed a bijection f : N2 →N, confirming that |N2|= |N|. 138\n\n 22. October 24 22.1. Basic Cardinality Comparisons 22.1.1. Countable vs. Uncountable Sets The main distinction among infinite sets that we will discuss is whether they can be placed in bijective correspondence with N. Definitions. A set X is called: • countably infinite if there exists a bijection f : N →X. In this case, we denote its cardinality by |X|= ℵ0. • countable (also called listable or denumerable) if X is either finite or countably infinite. • uncountable if X is infinite but not countably infinite. Up to this point, every set we have encountered is countable. To justify the existence of uncountable sets, we first need to understand why ℵ0 represents the “smallest” infinite cardinality. To do this, we must establish two facts: 1. N is not finite, and 2. if X is an infinite set, then there exists an injection f : N →X. We begin by showing that N is infinite. Specifically, we will prove that there is no bijection f : [n] →N for any n ∈N. The key ingredient is the following lemma. Lemma 22.1.1. If A ⊆N is finite and non-empty, then A has a maximum element. Proof. We proceed by induction on n = |A|. • Base Case: n = 1. Let A = {a1} for some a1 ∈N. Then a1 = max(A). • Inductive Step: Let n ∈Z+ and assume any non-empty finite subset of N with cardinality n has a maximum element. Let A ⊆N with |A|= n+1, and enumerate 139\n\n A as: A = {a1, a2, . . . , an, an+1}. Consider B = A ∖{an+1}. Then |B|= n, so by the inductive hypothesis, B has a maximum element. Let ak = max(B) for some k ∈[n]. We consider two cases: ▶Case 1: ak < an+1. Then for all i ∈[n + 1], ai ≤an+1, so an+1 = max(A). ▶Case 2: ak > an+1. Then ak ≥ai for all i ∈[n + 1], so ak = max(A). In either case, A has a maximum element. By the principle of mathematical induction, the lemma follows. Theorem 22.1.2. The set N is infinite. Proof. Assume, for contradiction, that N is finite. Since N ̸= ∅, there exists n ∈Z+ and a bijection f : [n] →N. Then we may write N = {f(1), f(2), . . . , f(n)}. By Lemma 22.1.1, N has a maximum element, say f(k). However, f(k) + 1 ∈N, contradicting that f(k) is maximal. Hence N is infinite. We have already shown that infinite sets exist, with N serving as one example. To establish that N is the “smallest” infinite set, we will show that it can be injected into any infinite set. Theorem 22.1.3. For any set A, either A is finite or there exists an injection f : N →A. Note. This proof relies on the Axiom of Countable Choice (ACC), which permits making an infinite sequence of choices. We present a simplified overview below. Proof. Let A be a set. If A is finite, there is nothing to prove. Otherwise, assume A is infinite. We will construct an injection f : N →A inductively. For each n ∈N, define Nn = {0, 1, . . . , n}. Choose an arbitrary element a0 ∈A and set f(0) = a0. Now let n ∈N and assume distinct elements f(k) ∈A have been chosen for all k ≤n. Since A is infinite, the set A ∖{f(k) | k ∈Nn} is nonempty. By the ACC, select an element an+1 ∈A ∖{f(k) | k ∈Nn} and define f(n + 1) = an+1. Proceeding in this manner defines a function f : N →A. By construction, f(n + 1) /∈ {f(k) | k ∈Nn}, so f(m) ̸= f(n) whenever m ̸= n. Hence, f is injective. 140\n\n This theorem supports the claim that ℵ0 is the smallest infinite cardinality, since every infinite set has at least this cardinality. A few immediate corollaries follow from this theorem. Corollaries 22.1.4. 1. A set A is infinite if and only if there exists a subset B ⊆A such that |B|= ℵ0. 2. Every subset A ⊆N is either finite or has cardinality |A|= ℵ0. 3. If f : A →N is an injection, then A is countable. 22.1.2. Linear Ordering of Cardinalities We can define a linear ordering of cardinalities on the class of all sets based on two important set-theoretic theorems. Definition. Let S and T be sets. We define: 1. |S|≤|T| if and only if there exists an injection f : S →T. 2. |S|≥|T| if and only if there exists a surjection g : S →T. The definition of |S|≤|T| is motivated by the Cantor–Bernstein–Schr¨oder theorem, which we will explore below. Note. If A and B are finite sets and there exist injections f : A →B and g : B →A, then both f and g must be bijections. In particular, if |A|≤|B| and |B|≤|A|, then |A|= |B|. Question: Does this result extend to infinite sets? Answer: Not directly. Example 22.1.5. Consider the sets N and 2N = {x ∈N | ∃y ∈N, x = 2y}. Define functions f : N →2N by f(n) = 4n and g : 2N →N by g(n) = n. Both f and g are injections, but neither is a bijection. Although having injections in both directions does not imply that the injections themselves are bijections, it does imply that some bijection must exist between the two sets. This result is known as the Cantor–Bernstein–Schr¨oder Theorem (CBS Theorem). 141\n\n Theorem 22.1.6 (Cantor–Bernstein–Schr¨oder (CBS) Theorem). Let A and B be sets. If there exist injections f : A →B and g : B →A, then there exists a bijection h : A →B. Proof. Assume that injections f and g exist. If Img(B) = A, then g is a bijection, and we are done. Otherwise, assume Img(B) ⊊A. Define the set S ⊆A as S = (A ∖Img(B)) ∪  [ n∈Z+ Im(g◦f)n(A ∖Img(B))  . Note that A ∖S ⊆Img(B). Let g−1 denote the inverse of g on the domain Img(B). Define the function h : A →B by h(x) = ( f(x) if x ∈S, g−1(x) if x /∈S. We claim that h is the desired bijection. • Injectivity: Suppose h(x) = h(y) for some x, y ∈A. We consider three cases: ▶Case 1: If x, y ∈S, then f(x) = f(y) implies x = y since f is injective. ▶Case 2: If x, y /∈S, then g−1(x) = g−1(y) implies x = y since g−1 is injective. ▶Case 3: Assume without loss of generality that x ∈S and y /∈S. Then f(x) = g−1(y) implies (g ◦f)(x) = y. Since x ∈S, we have x ∈Im(g◦f)k(A∖Img(B)) for some k ∈N, and thus y ∈Im(g◦f)k+1(A ∖Img(B)) ⊆S, contradicting the assumption that y /∈S. Hence, this case cannot occur. 142\n\n Therefore, h is injective. • Surjectivity: Let y ∈B be arbitrary. We consider two cases: ▶Case 1: If g(y) /∈S, let x = g(y). Then h(x) = g−1(x) = y, as required. ▶Case 2: If g(y) ∈S, then there exists some k ∈N such that g(y) = (g ◦f)k(x) for some x ∈A∖Img(B). Since k > 0, we can write g(y) = (g◦f)(z) = g(f(z)) for z = (g ◦f)k−1(x). Thus, y = f(z) and h(z) = f(z) = y. Therefore, h is surjective. Since h is both injective and surjective, we conclude that h : A →B is a bijection, and hence |A|= |B|. The CBS Theorem justifies our definition of |A|≤|B| when there exists an injection f : A →B. To establish |A|= |B|, it is often easier to show that there exist injections f : A →B and g : B →A than to construct an explicit bijection h : A →B. The CBS Theorem guarantees that if |A|≤|B| and |B|≤|A|, then |A|= |B|, providing the antisymmetry needed for a linear ordering. In practice, the CBS Theorem is used to confirm the existence of some bijection h : A →B without requiring the specific bijection constructed in its proof. To illustrate this, let us revisit Example 22.1.5. Example 22.1.7. Recall from Example 22.1.5 that we defined injections f : N →2N by f(x) = 4x and g : 2N →N by g(x) = x. Both f and g are injections, but neither is a bijection. To construct a bijection between N and 2N using the Cantor–Bernstein–Schr¨oder (CBS) Theorem, we begin by finding the complement of the image of g. Since Img(2N) = 2N, it follows that A ∖Img(B) is the set of odd natural numbers. Define S = (A ∖Img(B)) ∪Img◦f(A ∖Img(B)) ∪Img◦f◦g◦f(A ∖Img(B)) ∪· · · = {odd naturals} ∪{4 · odd naturals} ∪{16 · odd naturals} ∪· · · = {4m(2n + 1) | m, n ∈N}. The set S consists of numbers of the form 4m(2n + 1) for all m, n ∈N, capturing every element covered by the iterative application of f and g. Next, we construct the bijection h : N →2N: h(x) = ( 4x if x = 4m(2n + 1) for some m, n ∈N, x otherwise. This mapping sends each element of S to 4x, pairing it with a unique element of 2N, while leaving elements outside of S unchanged. To visualize this mapping, consider its action on the first few natural numbers: 143\n\n x h(x) x h(x) 1 4 7 28 2 2 8 8 3 12 9 36 4 16 10 10 5 20 11 44 6 6 12 48 The table illustrates how h maps elements from N to 2N. You should verify for yourself that this mapping is indeed injective and surjective, confirming h as a bijection. Note, however, that while the CBS theorem ensures the existence of such a bijection, it does not necessarily yield the simplest one. A much simpler bijection is j : N →2N defined by j(x) = 2x, which is more direct but does not arise from the CBS theorem’s construction. Finally, our definition of ≥is motivated by the following theorem, which tells us that the existence of an injection one way is equivalent to the existence of a surjection the other way. The proof is an elegant application of the Axiom of Choice, which we are assuming throughout. Theorem 22.1.8 (Partition Principle). Let A be a nonempty set and B any set. There exists an injection f : A →B if and only if there exists a surjection g : B →A. Proof sketch. (⇒): Suppose f : A →B is injective. We define a surjection g : B →A as follows: for b ∈Im(f), set g(b) = f−1(b) (well-defined since f is injective). For b /∈Im(f), map b to an arbitrary fixed a0 ∈A. This covers all a ∈A since g(f(a)) = a. (⇐): Suppose f : B →A is surjective. Then for each a ∈A, PreImf({a}) is nonempty. By the Axiom of Choice, there exists a function g : A →B such that g(a) ∈ PreImf({a}) for all a ∈A. (i.e., We select one element from PreImf({a}) for each a ∈A.) This function g is injective: if g(a1) = g(a2), then applying f gives a1 = f(g(a1)) = f(g(a2)) = a2. 144", "output": "Consider using mathematical induction.

October 27 23.1. Countable Sets Recall that a countably infinite set is a set S that has the same cardinality as N. This represents the smallest size of an infinite set, making it a natural starting point for exploring results about the sizes of infinite sets, which often defy intuition. For instance, we have already shown that there exists a bijection f : N →2N. This implies that |2N|= |N|, even though 2N ⊊N. In other words, there are just as many natural numbers as there are even natural numbers. We have also previously encountered bijections g : N →Z and h : N →N2. Thus, we can conclude that |2N|= |N|= |Z|= |N2|. Next, we will prove some important results about countable sets, beginning with a classic example. We will present two different proofs of this result: the traditional “snaking proof” and an alternative argument using the Cantor–Bernstein–Schr¨oder (CBS) Theorem. 23.1.1. Countability of the Rationals Theorem 23.1.1. The set of rational numbers Q is countably infinite. Proof. We aim to demonstrate the existence of a bijection f : N →Q. In other words, we seek an explicit way to enumerate all rational numbers so that every rational number appears at a finite position in the list. To do so, we arrange all rational numbers of the form a b in a two-dimensional array, where a ∈Z and b ∈Z+. Each entry of this array represents one rational number. We then traverse this array diagonally to ensure that every rational number is encountered within a finite number of steps. Since each diagonal contains only finitely many entries, this process covers the entire array. Beginning at 0, we “snake” our way through the diagonals, skipping any fractions that are not in lowest terms, as illustrated below. 146\n\n This traversal defines a function f : N →Q recursively, assigning to each natural number the corresponding rational number in the sequence. The beginning of this enumeration may be represented as follows: x 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 · · · f(x) 0 1 1 2 −1 2 −1 2 1 3 1 4 −1 3 · · · Every rational number appears exactly once in this list, and each appears at a finite index, establishing a bijection f : N →Q. Hence, Q is countably infinite. We now present an alternative proof that Q is countably infinite, this time using the Cantor–Bernstein–Schr¨oder (CBS) Theorem. For this proof, we assume the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, which we have partially established. Theorem 23.1.2 (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic (FTOA)). Every integer greater than 1 can be written uniquely as a product of prime numbers. We have already shown that every integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of primes. In a later section on number theory, we will prove the uniqueness of this factorization. For the purposes of this proof, we assume the full validity of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Theorem 23.1.3. The set Q is countably infinite. Proof. We will construct injections f : N →Q and g : Q →N. By the CBS Theorem, this will imply |N|= |Q|. 147\n\n • Define f : N →Q by f(n) = n 1 . If f(m) = f(n) for m, n ∈N, then m = n, so f is injective. Hence |N|≤|Q|. • To construct an injection g : Q →N, note that every rational number can be written uniquely in reduced form as a b, where a ∈Z, b ∈Z+, and gcd(a, b) = 1. Define g : Q →N by g \u0010a b \u0011 = ( 2a · 5b if a ≥0, 3−a · 5b if a < 0 where a b ∈Q is in reduced form. We now verify that g is injective. Suppose g(x) = g(y), where x = a1 b1 and y = a2 b2 , with ai ∈Z, bi ∈Z+, and gcd(ai, bi) = 1 for i = 1, 2. We consider three cases: ▶Case 1: a1, a2 ≥0. Then g(x) = g(y) implies 2a15b1 = 2a25b2. By the FTOA, we have a1 = a2 and b1 = b2. ▶Case 2: a1, a2 < 0. Then g(x) = g(y) implies 3−a15b1 = 3−a25b2, and again the FTOA gives a1 = a2 and b1 = b2. ▶Case 3: Without loss of generality, suppose a1 ≥0 and a2 < 0. Then 2a15b1 = 3−a25b2. By the FTOA, this forces a1 = a2 = 0, contradicting a2 < 0. Therefore, g is injective, and |Q|≤|N|. By the Cantor–Bernstein–Schr¨oder Theorem, we conclude that |N|= |Q|, so Q is countably infinite. We have already seen that several familiar sets are countable. We now establish some general results that allow us to construct new countable sets from previously known ones. 23.1.2. Properties of Countable Sets Recall that |N2|= |N|. Using this fact, together with induction, we can prove the following result. Theorem 23.1.4. For any n ∈Z+, |Nn|= ℵ0. Proof. Recall that |N2|= |N|, and let f : N2 →N be a bijection. We proceed by induction on n ∈Z+. • Base Case: For n = 1, we have |N1|= |N|= ℵ0, which holds by definition. 148\n\n • Inductive Step: Suppose that for some n ∈Z+, we have |Nn|= ℵ0. Then there exists a bijection g : Nn →N. Define a function h : Nn+1 →N2 by h((a1, a2, . . . , an), an+1) = (g(a1, a2, . . . , an), an+1). We show that h is a bijection. ▶Injectivity: Suppose h((a1, . . . , an), an+1) = h((b1, . . . , bn), bn+1). Then, by definition of h, (g(a1, . . . , an), an+1) = (g(b1, . . . , bn), bn+1), which implies that g(a1, . . . , an) = g(b1, . . . , bn) and an+1 = bn+1. Since g is injective, it follows that (a1, . . . , an) = (b1, . . . , bn), and hence ai = bi for all i ∈[n + 1]. Thus, h is injective. ▶Surjectivity: Let (x, y) ∈N2 be arbitrary. Since g is surjective, there exists (a1, . . . , an) ∈Nn such that g(a1, . . . , an) = x. Then for ((a1, . . . , an), y) ∈ Nn+1, h((a1, . . . , an), y) = (g(a1, . . . , an), y) = (x, y). Hence h is surjective. Since h is both injective and surjective, it is a bijection. Finally, the composition f ◦h : Nn+1 →N is a bijection, since it is the composition of two bijections. Therefore, |Nn+1|= |N|= ℵ0. By the principle of mathematical induction, we conclude that |Nn|= ℵ0 for all n ∈ Z+. Combining this result with the properties of finite Cartesian products, we obtain the following theorem. Theorem 23.1.5 (Finite Product of Countable Sets is Countable). If n ∈Z+ and X1, . . . , Xn are nonempty countable sets, then n Y i=1 Xi = X1 × X2 × · · · × Xn is countable. Moreover, if at least one Xi is infinite, then Qn i=1 Xi is countably infinite. 149\n\n We’ve seen that we can take finite Cartesian products of countable sets and remain countable. For unions of sets, we can do even better. The following result shows that a countably infinite union of countably infinite sets is still countably infinite. Theorem 23.1.6. Suppose {An}n∈N is a family of countably infinite sets. Then [ n∈N An is countably infinite. Proof. Let A = S n∈N An. We will show that ℵ0 ≤|A| and ℵ0 ≥|A|. • Since A0 is countably infinite, there exists a bijection f0 : N →A0. Define g : N → A by g(n) = f0(n). Because f0 is injective, g is also injective. Hence ℵ0 = |N|≤|A|. • For each n ∈N, let fn : N →An be a bijection (which exists because |An|= ℵ0 by assumption). Define h : N2 →A by h(n, m) = fn(m). We will show that h is surjective. Let a ∈A be arbitrary. Then a ∈An for some n ∈N. Fix such an n. Since fn is surjective, there exists m ∈N such that fn(m) = a. Thus h(n, m) = fn(m) = a. Because a ∈A was arbitrary, h is surjective. Therefore ℵ0 = |N2|≥|A|. By the Cantor–Bernstein–Schr¨oder Theorem and the partition principle, it follows that |A|= ℵ0, as desired. Since a countably infinite union of countably infinite sets is countably infinite, it follows that when we take either fewer unions or smaller sets, the union remains countable. Corollaries 23.1.7 (A Countable Union of Countable Sets is Countable). 1. If |A|= ℵ0 and |B|≤ℵ0, then |A ∪B|= ℵ0. 2. If {Ai}i∈N is a family of countable sets, then A = S i∈N Ai is countable. 3. If {Ai}i∈[n] (for some n ∈Z+) is a finite family of countable sets, then A = S i∈[n] Ai is countable. Moreover: a) If |Ai|= ℵ0 for at least one i ∈[n], then |A|= ℵ0. b) If each Ai is finite, then A is finite with |A|≥max{|Ai|}i∈[n]. Note. Regarding part (3b) in the previous corollary, we will discuss a formula for determining |A| in the combinatorics section later in the semester. 150", "output": "Consider using mathematical induction.

Uncountable Sets So far, we have shown that many different infinite sets share the same size as N. This might naturally lead to the question: do uncountably infinite sets even exist? In this section, we will not only demonstrate that uncountably infinite sets do exist, but also establish that there are multiple distinct sizes (cardinalities) among uncountably infinite sets. Our main proof technique will be a powerful method known as diagonalization. 23.2.1. Uncountability of the Real Numbers To show that the real numbers are uncountable, we need to establish that there is no possible way to enumerate them. How can we prove that such an enumeration cannot exist? As is often done in mathematics, we will proceed by contradiction. To make this argument concrete, we will describe real numbers using their decimal expansions and apply a diagonalization argument. A real number x ∈R can be represented in its decimal form as x = x0.x1x2x3 · · · , where x0 ∈Z is the integer part, and xi ∈N with 0 ≤xi ≤9 for i ∈Z+ represent the decimal digits. For example, 5 6 = 0.83333 · · · = 0.83. Technical Note: Decimal representations are not always unique. In particular, a decimal that ends with an infinite sequence of 9’s is equal to the corresponding decimal that ends with an infinite sequence of 0’s. (This is usually proved in Calculus 2 using geometric series.) For example, 0.499999 · · · = 0.50000 · · · . To avoid this ambiguity, we adopt the following convention: a decimal representation of x ∈R is said to be in normalized form if it does not end with an infinite string of 9’s. 151", "output": "Think about what proof technique would work best here: direct proof, contrapositive, or contradiction?", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}
{"instruction": "Give me a hint for solving the following problem.", "input": "(For those who have taken Calculus 2) Suppose that x ∈[0, 1) has two distinct decimal expansions: x = 0.a1a2a3 · · · , x = 0.b1b2b3 · · · , where ai, bi ∈{0, 1, . . . , 9} for all i. Let M be the smallest positive integer such that aM ̸= bM and assume that aM > bM. Prove that: • ai = bi for all 1 ≤i < M, • aM = bM + 1, • ai = 0 and bi = 9 for all i > M. With this convention in place, we can now use diagonalization to prove that there are uncountably many real numbers in the interval (0, 1). 152\n\n 24. October 29 24.1. Uncountable Sets 24.1.1. Uncountability of the Real Numbers Theorem 24.1.1. The open interval (0, 1) is uncountable. Proof. Let f : Z+ →(0, 1) be an arbitrary function. We aim to show that f is not surjective. For each n ∈Z+, write f(n) in normalized decimal form as f(1) = 0.c1,1c1,2c1,3 · · · f(2) = 0.c2,1c2,2c2,3 · · · f(3) = 0.c3,1c3,2c3,3 · · · f(4) = 0.c4,1c4,2c4,3 · · · ... ... We will construct a number x ∈(0, 1) such that x /∈Im(f). Define x by specifying its nth digit xn as xn = ( 1, if cn,n ̸= 1, 2, if cn,n = 1. By construction, xn ̸= cn,n for all n ∈Z+. Thus x differs from f(n) in the nth decimal place for every n, meaning x ̸= f(n) for all n ∈Z+. Since x ∈(0, 1) and x /∈Im(f), it follows that f is not surjective. Because f : Z+ →(0, 1) was chosen arbitrarily, this shows that ℵ0 = |Z+|< |(0, 1)|. Therefore, the interval (0, 1) is uncountable. Note. The proof above illustrates the general idea behind diagonalization: given any attempt to list all elements of a certain set (for example, f(1), f(2), f(3), . . . ), we construct a new element that systematically differs from each listed one in at least one place. More precisely, the diagonalization strategy involves the following pattern: 1. Assume, for contradiction, that an enumeration of the set exists. 153\n\n 2. Represent each element in a way that exposes infinitely many “coordinates” or distinguishable components (for example, digits of a real number, or values of a sequence). 3. Construct a new element by changing the nth coordinate (or component) of the nth listed element in a deliberate way. 4. Conclude that this new element differs from every element in the list, contradicting the assumption of a complete enumeration. The key feature of diagonalization is that the new element disagrees with the nth listed element in the nth component, ensuring that it is distinct from every item in the list. This strategy generalizes beyond decimal expansions. In each case, the heart of the argument is the same: no enumeration can capture every possible object once we can systematically construct one that escapes the list. Corollary 24.1.2. R is uncountable, and |R|= |(0, 1)|. Proof. Define f : (0, 1) →R by f(x) = ln \u00121 −x x \u0013 . Proving that f is a bijection was left as an exercise earlier. Since (0, 1) is uncountable and f is a bijection, it follows that R is also uncountable. Corollary 24.1.3. For any a, b ∈R with a < b, each of the following sets is uncountable: • (a, b) • (a, b] • [a, b) • [a, b] • (−∞, b) • (−∞, b] • (a, ∞) • [a, ∞) 24.1.2. Cantor’s Theorem Our diagonalization argument for the real numbers revealed that (0, 1) cannot be enumerated by the natural numbers. Cantor’s Theorem extends this idea even further: for any set S, the collection of all its subsets—its power set—is strictly larger than S itself. Theorem 24.1.4 (Cantor’s Theorem). For any set S, we have |S|< |P(S)|. 154\n\n Notes. • If S is finite, Cantor’s Theorem can be verified directly. In Homework 7, we proved that |P([n])|= 2n for all n ∈N, and it can be proven by induction that n < 2n for all n ∈N. • For infinite sets S, the theorem implies an infinite hierarchy of distinct infinite cardinalities, obtained by repeatedly taking power sets. For example: |N|< |P(N)|< |P(P(N))|< |P(P(P(N)))|< · · · Proof. Let S be an arbitrary set, and suppose g : S →P(S) is any function. Define a set T ∈P(S) by T = {x ∈S | x /∈g(x)}. We will show that T ̸= g(x) for any x ∈S. Let x ∈S be arbitrary. ▶Case 1: Suppose x ∈T. Then, by definition of T, we have x /∈g(x). Hence x ∈T but x /∈g(x), so T ̸= g(x). ▶Case 2: Suppose x /∈T. Then, by definition of T, we have x ∈g(x). Hence x /∈T but x ∈g(x), so again T ̸= g(x). Thus T ̸= g(x) for every x ∈S, meaning T is not in the image of g. Therefore g is not surjective. Since g : S →P(S) was arbitrary, no surjection from S onto P(S) exists, and hence |S|< |P(S)|. The construction in the proof is another example of diagonalization, where we created a new set T that disagrees with each g(x) regarding the membership of x. Example 24.1.5. To illustrate Cantor’s Theorem for the case S = N, we will show that no surjection f : N →P(N) can exist. Let f : N →P(N) be an arbitrary function, and define T = {n ∈N | n /∈f(n)}. We claim that T is not equal to f(n) for any n ∈N. To get some intuition, let us look at a few examples. • Suppose f(0) = {0, 3}. Then 0 /∈T because 0 ∈f(0), so T ̸= f(0). • Suppose f(1) = {5}. Then 1 ∈T because 1 /∈f(1), so T ̸= f(1). • Suppose f(2) = N. Then 2 /∈T because 2 ∈f(2), so T ̸= f(2). • Suppose f(3) = {1, 2, 4}. Then 3 ∈T because 3 /∈f(3), so T ̸= f(3). In each case, T differs from f(n) at the element n itself. More generally, for any n ∈N, we have two cases: 155\n\n ▶Case 1: If n ∈f(n), then n /∈T, so T ̸= f(n). ▶Case 2: If n /∈f(n), then n ∈T, so T ̸= f(n). Thus, for every n ∈N, the set T differs from f(n) in at least one element—specifically, at the “diagonal position” n. This pattern of constructing a new object that disagrees with the n-th object at the n-th coordinate is the essence of the diagonalization method. Since T ∈P(N) and T ̸= f(n) for all n ∈N, we conclude that f is not a surjection. Therefore, |N|< |P(N)|. Diagonalization thus provides a systematic way to construct an element not listed in any proposed enumeration. 24.1.3. Infinite Binary Sequences The technique used in Cantor’s Theorem also applies to other sets with infinite structure. One important example is the set of all infinite binary sequences. Although this result was proven in recitation, we restate it here to highlight its connection with Cantor’s argument. Theorem 24.1.6. Define {0, 1}N as the set of all infinite sequences consisting of 0s and 1s. That is, {0, 1}N = {⟨ai⟩i∈N | ∀i ∈N, ai ∈{0, 1}} . Then {0, 1}N is uncountably infinite. Cantor’s diagonal argument can be adapted to this setting by assuming we have an enumeration of all infinite binary sequences and then constructing a new sequence that differs from the n-th sequence at its n-th position. The resulting sequence cannot appear in the list, proving that no enumeration can include every element of {0, 1}N. Conceptually, this result is equivalent to Cantor’s Theorem for P(N): each infinite binary sequence can be viewed as the characteristic function of a subset of N. Thus, {0, 1}N and P(N) have the same cardinality, providing another example of how diagonalization exposes uncountable structures.", "output": "Consider using mathematical induction.

Introduction Number theory is possibly the oldest field of mathematics, and much of modern mathematics has its roots in it. The simplest description of number theory is the study of arithmetic. Number theorists investigate the fundamental properties of the integers, exploring their structure and relationships. At the heart of this field lies the study of prime numbers, which play a central role. Many of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics are found in number theory, often characterized by their simplicity to state but difficulty to solve. Examples of Number Theoretic Results and Conjectures 1. There are infinitely many ordered triples of positive integers (x, y, z) such that x2 + y2 = z2. 2. Fermat’s Last Theorem: There are no ordered triples of positive integers (x, y, z) such that xn + yn = zn for any n ≥3. 3. Lagrange’s Four-Square Theorem: Every nonnegative integer can be expressed as the sum of four perfect squares. For example, 35 = 52 + 32 + 12 + 02. 4. Goldbach’s Conjecture: Every even integer greater than 2 can be written as the sum of two prime numbers. For example, 14 = 3 + 11 (or 14 = 7 + 7). 5. Twin Prime Conjecture: There are infinitely many pairs of prime numbers of the form (p, p + 2). To begin our study of number theory, we will first review some relevant definitions and results from earlier sections. • A natural number n > 1 is called prime if its only divisors are 1 and itself. In other words, if n is prime and n = ab for a, b ∈N, then either a = 1 or b = 1 (Lecture 11). • A natural number n > 1 is called composite if there exist a, b ∈N such that 1 < a ≤b < n and n = ab. In other words, n > 1 and is not prime. • The natural number n = 1 is called a unit. 159\n\n • Every natural number n > 1 is either prime or can be expressed as a product of prime numbers (Theorem 11.1.7). We now state a useful result that was proved in class on September 8, and repeat the proof here for reference: Theorem 25.1.1. Let m, n ∈Z be nonzero integers. If m | n, then |m|≤|n|. Proof. Let m, n ∈Z ∖{0} such that m | n. Then there exists an integer a ∈Z such that n = ma. Since the absolute value function is multiplicative, we have |n|= |m|·|a|. Because m and n are nonzero, a ̸= 0, which implies |a|≥1. Therefore, |n|= |m|·|a|≥ |m|·1 = |m|. The following corollary is an immediate consequence of the theorem. Corollary 25.1.2. Let m, n ∈Z. If m | n and n | m, then m = ±n. From the definitions and results above, we know that every composite integer n has a prime factor p < n. In fact, we can say more: every composite integer n has a prime factor p ≤√n. This observation provides a straightforward (though inefficient) method for checking whether a natural number n is prime. Theorem 25.1.3. If n ∈N is composite, then n has a prime factor p such that p ≤√n. Proof. Let n ∈N be composite, and express n as n = ab for some a, b ∈N with 1 < a ≤b < n. We first show that a ≤√n. Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that a > √n. Then n = (√n)2 < a2 ≤ab = n, which yields the contradiction n < n. Therefore, a ≤√n. Let p be any prime divisor of a (possibly a itself, if a is prime). Then p ≤a ≤√n and, since p | a and a | n, it follows by transitivity that p | n. Example 25.1.4. Use the previous theorem to determine whether 91 or 97 is prime. Observe that √ 91 < √ 97 < 10, and the only prime numbers less than 10 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. To determine whether 91 or 97 is prime, we need to check if they are divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7. 160\n\n • It is clear that 2 ∤91 (since 91 is odd) and 5 ∤91 (since 91 does not end in 0 or 5). We also find that 3 ∤91, but we notice that 7 | 91 and 91 = 7 · 13. Thus, 91 is composite . • Similarly, 2 ∤97 and 5 ∤97. Checking for divisibility by 3 and 7, we find that 3 ∤97 and 7 ∤97. Therefore, 97 is prime .", "output": "Think about what proof technique would work best here: direct proof, contrapositive, or contradiction?", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

October 31 26.1. GCDs, LCMs, and Linear Combinations By Theorem 25.1.1, if n is a nonzero integer, then n can have only finitely many divisors, since m | n implies |m|≤|n|. Because any two nonzero integers each have finitely many divisors, it is natural to define the greatest divisor common to both. In fact, we can relax this requirement so that only one of the integers must be nonzero. Definition. For a, b ∈Z, not both zero, an integer d is called a common divisor of a and b if d | a and d | b. Furthermore, d is called the greatest common divisor of a and b, denoted gcd(a, b), if d is the largest of their common divisors. Examples 26.1.1. 1. Consider m = 54 and n = 42. Set of divisors of 54 = {±1, ±2, ±3, ±6, ±9, ±18, ±27, ±54}, Set of divisors of 42 = {±1, ±2, ±3, ±6, ±7, ±14, ±21, ±42}, Set of common divisors = {±1, ±2, ±3, ±6}. Therefore, gcd(54, 42) = 6, the largest element from the set of common divisors. 2. gcd(−6, −15) = 3. Even though both integers are negative, the greatest common divisor is always taken to be positive. 3. gcd(0, 44) = 44. Since every integer divides 0, we have gcd(0, n) = |n| for any integer n ̸= 0. (The value gcd(0, 0) is undefined.) Since the divisors of −m are the same as those of m, it follows that gcd(m, n) = gcd(|m|, |n|). Therefore, we often restrict our attention to pairs of nonnegative integers. Definition. Let a, b ∈Z, not both zero. Then a and b are called relatively prime (or coprime) if gcd(a, b) = 1. The following theorem states that if we divide a and b by their greatest common divisor, then the resulting integers have no common divisors other than ±1. This simple but powerful result is foundational in the study of arithmetic. 162\n\n Theorem 26.1.2. Let a, b ∈Z, not both zero. If gcd(a, b) = d, then gcd \u0012a d, b d \u0013 = 1. Proof. Let a, b ∈Z, not both zero, and let d = gcd(a, b). Suppose n ∈Z+ divides both a d and b d. Then there exist integers k, ℓ∈Z such that a d = nk and b d = nℓ, which implies a = nkd and b = nℓd. Hence, nd is a common divisor of a and b. Since d = gcd(a, b), we must have nd ≤d, and therefore n = 1 because n, d ∈Z+. Thus, gcd \u0012a d, b d \u0013 = 1.", "output": "Try to express this using set notation and apply the relevant set operations or identities.", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

The Euclidean Algorithm The Euclidean Algorithm is a well-known and efficient method for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. Its foundation rests on the following lemma. Theorem 26.1.4 (EA Theorem). Let a, b ∈Z with b ̸= 0. For any k ∈Z, gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a −bk). Proof. We will show that a and b have the same set of common divisors as b and a −bk, using a double-containment argument. • Suppose c ∈Z is a common divisor of a and b, i.e., c | a and c | b. Then there exist x, y ∈Z such that a = cx and b = cy. It follows that a −bk = c(x −yk), so c | (a −bk). Thus, c is a common divisor of b and a −bk. 163\n\n • Conversely, suppose c ∈Z is a common divisor of b and a −bk, i.e., c | b and c | (a −bk). Then there exist x, y ∈Z such that b = cx and a −bk = cy. Hence, a = (a −bk) + bk = cy + cxk = c(y + xk), and therefore c | a. Thus, c is a common divisor of a and b. Since the two pairs share the same common divisors, it follows that gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a− bk). Given that gcd(a, b) = gcd(|a|, |b|) and gcd(a, 0) = |a| (for a ̸= 0), the Euclidean Algorithm is used to find the GCD of two positive integers. Strategy: The Euclidean Algorithm Let a, b ∈Z with a > b > 0. • Set r0 = a and r1 = b. • For j ≥2, apply the Division Algorithm to divide rj−2 by rj−1, yielding rj−2 = qj−1rj−1 + rj, where 0 ≤rj < rj−1. • Terminate the process when rn = 0. • The last nonzero remainder, rn−1, is equal to gcd(a, b). The Idea. The algorithm produces a strictly decreasing sequence of nonnegative remainders: r0 > r1 > r2 > · · · > rn−1 > rn = 0. By the well-ordering property of the natural numbers, this sequence must eventually terminate with a remainder of 0. Applying Theorem 26.1.4 repeatedly gives gcd(a, b) = gcd(r0, r1) = gcd(r1, r2) = gcd(r2, r3) ... = gcd(rn−1, 0) = rn−1. This procedure will be clarified through a concrete example. 164\n\n Example 26.1.5.

Linear Combinations The Euclidean Algorithm can be used to find integers x and y such that ax + by = gcd(a, b). Example 26.1.8. Performing the Euclidean Algorithm on 148 and 40, we have: 148 = 40 · 3 + 28, 40 = 28 · 1 + 12, 28 = 12 · 2 + 4, 12 = 4 · 3 + 0. Thus, gcd(148, 40) = 4. To express 4 as a linear combination of 148 and 40, we solve for the remainders in the first three equations: 28 = 148 −3 · 40, 12 = 40 −1 · 28, 4 = 28 −2 · 12. Substituting the second equation into the expression for 4 gives: 4 = 28 −2 · (40 −28) = 3 · 28 −2 · 40. 165\n\n Next, substituting the expression for 28 yields: 4 = 3 · (148 −3 · 40) −2 · 40 = 3 · 148 −11 · 40. Therefore, gcd(148, 40) = 3 · 148 −11 · 40. The values x = 3 and y = −11 found in the previous example are not unique. In fact, there are infinitely many integer pairs (x, y) satisfying 148x + 40y = 4. However, gcd(148, 40) is the smallest positive integer that can be written in the form 148x + 40y. The following theorem establishes this general result. Theorem 26.1.9 (B´ezout’s Lemma). Let a, b ∈Z, not both zero. Then: 1. There exist x, y ∈Z such that ax + by = gcd(a, b). 2. If x, y ∈Z satisfy ax + by > 0, then ax + by ≥gcd(a, b). Proof. We will prove both statements simultaneously. Define the set S ⊆Z+ by S = {c ∈Z+ | ∃x, y ∈Z, (ax + by = c)}. Since |a|+|b|∈S, the set S is non-empty. By the Well-Ordering Property, S has a least element. Let d = ma + nb, where m, n ∈Z, be the smallest element of S. To establish both conditions, we need to show that d = gcd(a, b). To show that d | a, let q, r ∈Z be such that 0 ≤r < d and a = dq + r, as guaranteed by the Division Algorithm. Solving for r and substituting d = ma + nb, we get: r = a −dq = a −(ma + nb)q = (1 −qm)a + (−qn)b. Thus, r can be written in the form ax + by, but since r < d, it must be that r /∈S, implying r = 0. Hence, d | a. An identical argument shows that d | b, making d a common divisor of a and b. To show that d is the greatest common divisor, let t ∈Z+ be a common divisor of a and b. Then there exist k, ℓ∈Z such that a = tk and b = tℓ. Substituting these into d = ma + nb, we obtain: d = mtk + ntℓ= t(mk + nℓ). Thus, t | d. Since both t and d are positive, we conclude t ≤d, establishing that d = gcd(a, b). Several useful consequences follow immediately from B´ezout’s Lemma. We will discuss many of these in recitation, but you are encouraged to try proving them on your own. One is left as an exercise below. 166\n\n Corollaries 26.1.10.

November 3 27.1. GCDs, LCMs, and Linear Combinations 27.1.1. Linear Diophantine Equations A Diophantine equation is a polynomial equation with integer coefficients, typically involving multiple variables, in which the goal is to find integer (or sometimes rational) solutions. The study of such equations forms a central area of research in Number Theory, with applications ranging from cryptography to mathematical puzzles. Diophantine equations come in many forms, varying greatly in difficulty and complexity. In this course, we will focus on a specific type of Diophantine equation called linear Diophantine equations, which involve polynomials of degree one. To motivate our exploration, let’s look at a few examples that illustrate the variety and challenges of Diophantine problems: Examples 27.1.1. 1. Find all (x, y) ∈Z2 such that y2 = x3 + 16. This is an example of a Mordell equation, a type of cubic Diophantine equation. These equations often have only a few integer solutions or none at all. For this particular equation, the only integer solutions are (0, 4) and (0, −4). 2. Find all n ∈Z that can be expressed as the sum of three cubes, i.e., ∃x, y, z ∈Z, n = x3 + y3 + z3. This is an example of a longstanding open problem in number theory. While some values of n have been resolved, finding solutions for all n remains an unsolved challenge. 3. Find all (x, y) ∈Z2 such that 6x + 9y = 27. This is a linear Diophantine equation, which we will study in detail. Unlike the previous examples, linear Diophantine equations can often be solved systematically, and we will develop techniques to find all solutions. 168\n\n A Diophantine equation of the form ax + by = c, where a, b, c ∈Z, is called a linear Diophantine equation in two variables. We know from B´ezout’s lemma that ∃x, y ∈Z such that ax + by = c if and only if gcd(a, b) | c. If a solution exists, we can find one such solution using the Reverse Euclidean Algorithm, as illustrated in Example 26.1.8. First, find x′, y′ ∈Z such that ax′ + by′ = gcd(a, b). For instance, in Example 26.1.8, we found that gcd(148, 40) = 4 = 148(3) + 40(−11). Since gcd(a, b) | c, we can find one solution to ax + by = c by multiplying the equation ax′ + by′ = gcd(a, b) by c gcd(a,b). For instance, if c = 36, then multiplying the previous equation by 9 gives 36 = 148(27) + 40(−99). Now that we know how to find one solution to ax+by = c, how do we find all solutions? Are there others? And if so, how many? Let’s first get a basic idea of how we can use one solution to find all solutions through the following example. Example 27.1.2. Find all integral solutions to 6x + 9y = 21. x, y ∈Z satisfy 6x + 9y = 21 if and only if 2x + 3y = 7 (dividing through by gcd(6, 9)). Thus, it suffices to find all solutions to 2x + 3y = 7. Since the numbers are small, we can guess a solution: 2(2) + 3(1) = 7. Thus, (2, 1) is one solution to the equation. Now, suppose (x, y) ∈Z2 is any solution to 2x + 3y = 7. We then have 2x + 3y = 7 = 2(2) + 3(1). This equation holds if and only if 2(x −2) = 3(1 −y). Let m = x −2 and n = 1 −y, so our equation becomes 2m = 3n. Since 2m is even (and 2 ∤3), it must be the case that 2 | n, hence n = 2k for some k ∈Z. Substituting this into our previous equation gives 2m = 6k =⇒m = 3k. Using m = x −2 and n = 1 −y, we find x = 2 + 3k and y = 1 −2k. Thus, any solution must be of the form (2 + 3k, 1 −2k) for some k ∈Z. Furthermore, we can verify that any ordered pair of this form satisfies the Diophantine equation: 2(2 + 3k) + 3(1 −2k) = 4 + 6k + 3 −6k = 7. Hence, the solution set is {(2 + 3k, 1 −2k) | k ∈Z}. 169\n\n We summarize the result below. The proof, which generalizes the previous example, is left for homework. Theorem 27.1.3. Let a, b, c ∈Z with a and b not both zero. If gcd(a, b) | c, then there are infinitely many integer solutions to ax + by = c. Moreover, if (x0, y0) is one solution, then all solutions are given by {(x0 + m(b/d), y0 −m(a/d)) | m ∈Z, d = gcd(a, b)}. Proof. Homework.", "output": "Consider using mathematical induction.

Definition. Let a, b, c ∈Z ∖{0}. We say that c is a common multiple of a and b if a | c and b | c. Furthermore, c is called the least common multiple of a and b, denoted lcm[a, b], if c > 0 and c is the smallest of all positive common multiples of a and b. The following theorem establishes a key property of the least common multiple. Theorem 27.1.5. Let a, b ∈Z, not both zero. For any n ∈Z, we have lcm[a, b] | n if and only if a | n and b | n. Proof. (⇒): Suppose lcm[a, b] | n. Since a | lcm[a, b] and b | lcm[a, b], the transitivity of divisibility implies that a | n and b | n. Thus, n is a common multiple of a and b. (⇐): Suppose a | n and b | n. By the division algorithm, there exist q, r ∈Z with 0 ≤r < lcm[a, b] such that n = q · lcm[a, b] + r. Since a | n and a | lcm[a, b], we have a | (n −q · lcm[a, b]), implying a | r by the properties of divisibility. A similar argument shows that b | r. 170\n\n Since 0 ≤r < lcm[a, b] and r is a common multiple of a and b, it follows that r = 0. Hence, lcm[a, b] | n. The following corollaries capture additional useful properties of the least common multiple. Their proofs are left as exercises. Corollaries 27.1.6. Let a, b ∈Z, not both zero.

Once the greatest common divisor is known, the least common multiple can be determined directly using the GCD-LCM relationship. 27.2. Prime Factorizations Prime numbers are often referred to as the building blocks of the integers. One of the most significant properties of integers is that every positive integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of prime numbers in exactly one way, up to the order of the factors. This result is known as the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. The decomposition of integers into their prime factors is a powerful tool in mathematics, with applications ranging from simplifying fractions to enabling secure encryption methods. The key result needed to establish this theorem is derived from B´ezout’s Lemma. Theorem 27.2.1 (Euclid’s Lemma). Let a, b, c ∈Z. If a and b are relatively prime (i.e., gcd(a, b) = 1) and a | bc, then a | c. 171\n\n Proof. Let a, b, c ∈Z such that gcd(a, b) = 1 and a | bc. Since gcd(a, b) = 1, B´ezout’s Lemma guarantees the existence of integers m, n ∈Z such that am + bn = 1. Fix such values of m and n. Since a | bc, there exists some k ∈Z such that bc = ak. Multiplying both sides of am + bn = 1 by c gives amc + bnc = c. Substituting bc = ak into the equation, we get c = amc + akn = a(mc + kn). Thus, a | c, as required. The following corollary is a special case of Euclid’s Lemma when a is a prime number. Corollary 27.2.2. Let p, b, c ∈Z with p prime. If p | bc, then p | b or p | c. 172\n\n 28. November 5 28.1. Prime Factorizations We now have the necessary tools to establish the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Theorem 28.1.1 (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic). Every integer n > 1 can be uniquely written as a product of prime numbers, up to the order of the prime factors. In other words, if n = p1 · p2 · · · pr = q1 · q2 · · · qs for prime numbers pi and qj such that p1 ≤p2 ≤· · · ≤pr and q1 ≤q2 ≤· · · ≤qs, then r = s and pi = qi for each i ∈[r]. Proof. Existence – This has already been established in Theorem 11.1.7. Uniqueness – Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a positive integer n such that n > 1 and n has two distinct prime factorizations. Let n0 be the smallest such integer, according to the well-ordering property. Then, there exist positive integers k, ℓ∈Z+ and prime numbers pi and qj for 1 ≤i ≤k and 1 ≤j ≤ℓsuch that n0 = k Y i=1 pi = ℓY j=1 qj. We consider two cases: • Case 1: k = 1 or ℓ= 1. Without loss of generality, assume k = 1. Then n0 = p1 = ℓY j=1 qj. Since p1 is prime, it must be that ℓ= 1 and hence n0 = p1 = q1. This contradicts the assumption that the prime factorizations were distinct. 173\n\n • Case 2: k, ℓ≥2. Since p1 | n0, it follows that p1 | Qℓ j=1 qj. Because p1 is prime, the corollary to Euclid’s Lemma implies that there exists some j ∈[ℓ] such that p1 | qj. By relabeling the qj’s if necessary, we may assume that p1 | q1. This implies that q1 = p1 since q1 is prime. Then n0 p1 is an integer greater than 1, and n0 p1 = k Y i=2 pi = ℓY j=2 qj. Since k, ℓ≥2, this shows that n0 p1 has two distinct prime factorizations. But n0 p1 < n0, contradicting the assumption that n0 was the smallest integer greater than 1 with two distinct prime factorizations. Since these are the only two cases and they both lead to contradictions, we conclude that every integer n > 1 can be written uniquely as a product of primes. Examples 28.1.2. 1. 240 = 2 · 2 · 2 · 2 · 3 · 5 = 24 · 3 · 5. Moreover, this is the only way to factor 240 into a product of prime numbers. Viewing the prime numbers as the building blocks, we see that 240 is composed of 4 copies of 2, 1 copy of 3, and 1 copy of 5. 2. 289 = 17 · 17 = 172 3. 1001 = 7 · 11 · 13 Our next result establishes a fact that we have been assuming implicitly for some time. Corollary 28.1.3 (Infinitude of Primes). There are infinitely many prime numbers. Proof. Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there are only finitely many prime numbers, say n primes for some n ∈Z+. List these primes as p1, p2, . . . , pn. Define P ∈N to be one more than the product of these primes, i.e., P = n Y i=1 pi ! + 1 = p1p2 · · · pn + 1. Since P > 1, the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic implies that P has at least one prime divisor. Given that there are only finitely many primes, it follows that pj | P for some j ∈{1, 2, . . . , n}. Thus, we can write P = pjk for some k ∈Z. 174\n\n However, pj also divides nQ i=1 pi (as pj is one of the factors in the product), so we can express nQ i=1 pi = pjℓfor some ℓ∈Z. Consequently, we have 1 = P − n Y i=1 pi = pj(k −ℓ), which implies pj | 1. This is a contradiction, as no prime number divides 1. Therefore, our original assumption must be false, and there are indeed infinitely many prime numbers. Note. This proof shows that if p1, . . . , pn are the first n prime numbers, then the next prime could be as large as P = n Y i=1 pi ! + 1. However, this is a significant overestimate. For example, this method would imply that p10 ≤223092871, while in reality, p10 = 29. 28.1.1. Divisors Let P be the set of prime numbers. For each p ∈P and n ∈Z+, define vp(n) = max{a ∈N | pa divides n} as the largest power of p dividing n. If a, b, and n are positive integers such that n = ab, then for all p ∈P, we have vp(n) = vp(a) + vp(b). Hence, vp(a) ≤vp(n). This implies that if n has a prime factorization n = pn1 1 pn2 2 · · · pnk k , then we can express a as a = pa1 1 pa2 2 · · · pak k , for some ai where 0 ≤ai ≤ni for each 1 ≤i ≤k. (Note that we allow ai = 0 for any or all values of i.) Since any positive divisor must be of this form, and any integer of this form is indeed a divisor of n, we have now classified all divisors of n. This allows us to count the number of divisors of n. • For an arbitrary divisor a of n, there are ni + 1 possible values for vpi(a). • Since there are k distinct primes in the prime factorization of n, the total number of divisors of n is given by kQ i=1 (ni + 1). 175\n\n GCDs and LCMs Revisited We can use the above ideas to provide an alternative characterization of GCDs and LCMs. Theorem 28.1.4. Let a, b ∈Z be greater than 1. Further, let {p1, . . . , pn} be the set of all prime factors of either a or b. Then we can express a and b as a = n Y i=1 pai i and b = n Y i=1 pbi i , where ai ≥0 and bi ≥0 for 1 ≤i ≤n. Then gcd(a, b) = n Y i=1 pmin{ai,bi} i , lcm[a, b] = n Y i=1 pmax{ai,bi} i . Proof. Let d = gcd(a, b). For each 1 ≤i ≤n, we have vpi(d) ≤ai and vpi(d) ≤bi. Thus, vpi(d) ≤min{ai, bi}. Moreover, nQ i=1 pmin{ai,bi} i divides a, as seen from a = n Y i=1 pmin{ai,bi} i ! n Y i=1 pai−min{ai,bi} i ! . Similarly, nQ i=1 pmin{ai,bi} i divides b. Since d is the greatest common divisor of a and b, we must have vpi(d) = min{ai, bi} for all i. Therefore, d = nQ i=1 pmin{ai,bi} i . A similar argument establishes the result for the least common multiple. Example 28.1.5. Consider the integers 720 and 700. We have 720 = 24 · 32 · 51 · 70, 700 = 22 · 30 · 52 · 71, gcd(720, 700) = 22 · 30 · 51 · 70, lcm[720, 700] = 24 · 32 · 52 · 71. Hence, gcd(720, 700) = 20 and lcm(720, 700) = 25200. The GCD-LCM Theorem 27.1.8 follows immediately from the previous theorem. 176\n\n Corollary 28.1.6 (GCD-LCM Theorem).

Modular Arithmetic Recall: For m ∈Z+ and a, b ∈Z, we say that a is congruent to b modulo m, denoted a ≡b (mod m), if and only if m | (a−b). We proved in Theorem 18.1.3 that congruence modulo m is an equivalence relation. The set of equivalence classes (often called congruence classes in this context) is denoted by Z/mZ = {[a]m | a ∈Z}. In computer science, “mod” is often treated as an operation that takes an integer a as input and returns the remainder r when a is divided by m. As a relation, this means a ≡r (mod m) (equivalently, [a]m = [r]m). This interpretation can be justified by the following theorem. Theorem 28.2.1. For all a, b ∈Z and all m ∈Z+, we have a ≡b (mod m) ⇐⇒a and b have the same remainder when divided by m. Proof. Let a, b ∈Z and m ∈Z+. By the Division Algorithm, there exist unique integers q1, r1, q2, r2 ∈Z such that a = mq1 + r1 and b = mq2 + r2, 177\n\n where 0 ≤r1 < m and 0 ≤r2 < m. We will show that a ≡b (mod m) if and only if r1 = r2. (⇒): Suppose a ≡b (mod m). Then m | (a −b), so there exists k ∈Z such that a −b = mk. Substituting our expressions for a and b, we get mk = m(q1 −q2) + (r1 −r2). Solving for r1 −r2 gives r1 −r2 = m(k −(q1 −q2)), which shows that m | (r1 −r2). Since 0 ≤r1, r2 < m, we have −m < r1 −r2 < m, and the only multiple of m in this range is 0. Hence r1 −r2 = 0, so r1 = r2. (⇐): Suppose r1 = r2. Then a −b = m(q1 −q2), which implies m | (a −b), and therefore a ≡b (mod m). The following corollary is immediate. Corollary 28.2.2. Let m ∈Z+. Every integer is congruent to exactly one element of the set {0, 1, . . . , m −1} modulo m. Equivalently, Z/mZ = {[0]m, [1]m, . . . , [m −1]m}. The set {0, 1, . . . , m−1} is an example of what we call a complete set of residues modulo m. Definition. For m ∈Z+, a set {a1, . . . , am} ⊂Z is called a complete set of residues modulo m if every integer is congruent to exactly one element of {a1, . . . , am} modulo m. Examples 28.2.3. There are infinitely many complete sets of residues modulo m, but some are more commonly used than others. • Least Nonnegative Residues modulo m: {0, 1, . . . , m −1}. • Least Positive Residues modulo m: {1, 2, . . . , m}. • Least Absolute Residues modulo m: ▶If m is odd: {0, 1, −1, 2, −2, . . . , m−1 2 , −m−1 2 }. ▶If m is even: {0, 1, −1, 2, −2, . . . , m−2 2 , −m−2 2 , m 2 }. 178\n\n Example 28.2.4.

Modular Arithmetic The main advantage of working with congruences is that it simplifies arithmetic involving remainders, as the standard rules for addition, subtraction, and multiplication still apply. Division, however, requires special consideration, which we will address later. Theorem 29.1.1 (Modular Arithmetic Lemma). Let m ∈Z+ and a, b, c, d ∈Z. If a ≡b (mod m) and c ≡d (mod m), then: 1. a ± c ≡b ± d (mod m) 2. ac ≡bd (mod m) Proof. Let a, b, c, d ∈Z and m ∈Z+. Suppose a ≡b (mod m) and c ≡d (mod m). Then m | (a −b) and m | (c −d), so there exist integers k, ℓ∈Z such that a −b = mk and c −d = mℓ. We now verify each claim. 1. Using a −b = mk and c −d = mℓ, we find (a ± c) −(b ± d) = (a −b) ± (c −d) = mk ± mℓ= m(k ± ℓ). Hence m | (a ± c −(b ± d)), so a ± c ≡b ± d (mod m). 2. Substituting a = b + mk and c = d + mℓ, we have ac = (b + mk)(d + mℓ) = bd + m(kd + ℓb + mkℓ). Thus m | (ac −bd), so ac ≡bd (mod m). Remark. Another way to interpret Theorem 29.1.1 is that we have defined addition and multiplication on Z/mZ by [a]m + [b]m = [a + b]m, [a]m · [b]m = [ab]m. 180\n\n The Modular Arithmetic Lemma guarantees that these operations are well-defined: the results do not depend on the choice of representatives for the equivalence classes. Consequently, Z/mZ carries a natural algebraic structure. Let us now explore some examples illustrating what we can and cannot do as a result of the Modular Arithmetic Lemma. Examples 29.1.2. • For x ∈Z, x + 10 ≡x + 3 (mod 7) since 10 ≡3 (mod 7). This shows that we can reduce the constants appearing in a sum modulo 7. • For x, y ∈Z, if x ≡y (mod 7), then x+3 ≡y+3 (mod 7). This demonstrates that we can add the same number to both sides of a congruence, just as with ordinary equations, and the equivalence remains valid. • For x, y ∈Z, if x + 3 ≡y (mod 7), then x ≡y −3 (mod 7). We can therefore subtract the same number from both sides of a congruence and maintain the equivalence. Moreover, since −3 ≡4 (mod 7), we could also write x ≡y + 4 (mod 7). • For x ∈Z, if x ≡3 (mod 7), then 2x ≡6 (mod 7). This shows that we can multiply both sides of a congruence by 2 without breaking equivalence. Since 6 ≡−1 (mod 7), this can also be written as 2x ≡−1 (mod 7). The following corollary follows from a straightforward induction argument, which we leave to the reader. Corollary 29.1.3. Let m ∈Z+ and a, b ∈Z. If a ≡b (mod m), then an ≡bn (mod m) for all n ∈Z+.", "output": "Consider using mathematical induction.

The Problem with Division We have established that addition, subtraction, and multiplication are well-defined operations modulo m, but division remains problematic. The following examples illustrate why: • If 2x ≡1 (mod m), we cannot conclude that x ≡ 1 2 (mod m), since 1 2 /∈Z, and congruences modulo m are defined only over integers. (Recall that it is an equivalence relation on Z.) • If 6x ≡21 (mod m), we cannot divide both sides by 3 directly. For example, 6 ≡21 (mod 15), but 2 ̸≡7 (mod 15). However, we do have 2 ≡7 (mod 15 3 ). 181\n\n The next theorem clarifies how certain forms of division can still be managed within modular arithmetic. Theorem 29.1.5 (Cancellation Law). For a, b, c ∈Z and m ∈Z+, if d = gcd(c, m) and ac ≡bc (mod m), then a ≡b (mod m d ). Proof. Let a, b, c ∈Z and m ∈Z+. Assume ac ≡bc (mod m), which implies that m | (ac−bc), or equivalently, c(a−b) = mk for some k ∈Z. Let d = gcd(c, m). Dividing both sides of the equation by d, we obtain \u0010 c d \u0011 (a −b) = \u0010m d \u0011 k. Thus, m d | \u0000 c d \u0001 (a −b). By Theorem 26.1.2, we know that gcd \u0000 c d, m d \u0001 = 1, so by Euclid’s Lemma it follows that m d | (a −b). Hence, a ≡b (mod m d ). Example 29.1.6. • Consider the congruence 24x ≡18y (mod 45). We wish to divide both sides by 6 to simplify. Since gcd(6, 45) = 3, the modulus reduces by this factor, yielding 4x ≡3y (mod 15). • For 24x ≡18y (mod 46), we have gcd(6, 46) = 2, so dividing by 6 gives 4x ≡3y (mod 23). • Finally, if 24x ≡18y (mod 47), then gcd(6, 47) = 1 (since 47 is prime). In this case, the modulus remains unchanged: 4x ≡3y (mod 47).", "output": "Consider using mathematical induction.

Multiplicative Inverses There is another analogue of division in modular arithmetic that applies when the divisor has certain properties. Recall that for a nonzero real number x, dividing by x is equivalent to multiplying by its multiplicative inverse y = 1 x, where xy = 1. The number 182\n\n y is called the multiplicative inverse of x because their product equals one. We now wish to generalize this idea to congruences modulo m. We investigate multiplicative inverses in Z/mZ. Let m ∈Z+ and a ∈Z. We ask: under what conditions does [a]m have a multiplicative inverse in Z/mZ? Equivalently, for which integers a does there exist an integer b such that ab ≡1 (mod m)? If such a b exists, we denote it by b ≡a−1 (mod m). Note that a−1 does not represent the rational number 1 a (which may not be an integer); instead, it denotes the multiplicative inverse of a modulo m. This notation parallels that used for inverses of bijections. Theorem 29.1.8 (MIRP Theorem). Let m ∈Z+ and a ∈Z. Then a and m are relatively prime if and only if there exists b ∈Z such that ab ≡1 (mod m). Equivalently, gcd(a, m) = 1 if and only if [a]m has a multiplicative inverse in Z/mZ. Before proving the theorem, let us consider a few examples. Examples 29.1.9. • There is no solution to 6x ≡1 (mod 21) because gcd(6, 21) = 3 ̸= 1. • There is a solution to 5x ≡1 (mod 21) since gcd(5, 21) = 1. Indeed, 5 · 17 = 85 ≡1 (mod 21). Thus, 5−1 ≡17 (mod 21). By the Modular Arithmetic Lemma (Theorem 29.1.1), the congruence 5x ≡1 (mod 21) holds for all x ∈[17]21. Alternatively, we can express this multiplicative inverse in Z/21Z as [5]21 · [17]21 = [1]21. We now proceed with the proof of the MIRP Theorem. Proof. Let m ∈Z+ and a ∈Z. (⇒): Suppose gcd(a, m) = 1. By B´ezout’s Lemma, there exist integers k, ℓsuch that ak + mℓ= 1. Fix such k, ℓ. Then ak + mℓ≡ak (mod m), so ak ≡1 (mod m). Hence, a has a multiplicative inverse modulo m. (⇐): Conversely, assume there exists k ∈Z such that ak ≡1 (mod m). Then m | (ak −1), so ak −1 = mℓfor some ℓ∈Z. Rearranging gives ak + m(−ℓ) = 1, which implies gcd(a, m) = 1 by B´ezout’s Lemma, since 1 is a linear combination of a and m. 183\n\n The following corollary states that if a multiplicative inverse exists, it is unique modulo m. Corollary 29.1.10. Let m ∈Z+ and a ∈Z such that gcd(a, m) = 1. If k, ℓ∈Z satisfy ak ≡1 (mod m) and aℓ≡1 (mod m), then k ≡ℓ(mod m). Example 29.1.11. Find all x ∈Z such that 4x ≡5 (mod 7). First, note that 4 is invertible modulo 7 since gcd(4, 7) = 1. We find that 4−1 ≡2 (mod 7) because 4 · 2 = 8 ≡1 (mod 7). Now, let x ∈Z satisfy 4x ≡5 (mod 7). Multiplying both sides by 2 gives 2 · 4x ≡2 · 5 (mod 7). Simplifying, we obtain x ≡3 (mod 7). Therefore, the set of solutions is {x ∈Z | 4x ≡5 (mod 7)} = [3]7. The following corollary characterizes when a linear congruence modulo m has a solution. Corollary 29.1.12. Let a, b ∈Z and m ∈Z+. The congruence ax ≡b (mod m) has a solution if and only if gcd(a, m) | b. Proof. You will work through this proof in recitation. Finding Multiplicative Inverses Question: Given gcd(a, m) = 1, how do we find a multiplicative inverse of a modulo m? Answer: There are several ways to do this. 1 Mental Math. If m is small, the most efficient method may be to solve mentally or use guess-andcheck, since there are only a few possible residues. 184\n\n Example 29.1.13. Find x ∈Z such that 7x ≡1 (mod 15). Considering the set of least positive residues modulo 15, the only possible inverses of 7 modulo 15 are the integers between 1 and 15 that are relatively prime to 15: {1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14}. We can rule out 1 and 14, since 7 · 1 ≡7 (mod 15), 7 · 14 ≡7(−1) ≡−7 (mod 15). Additionally, we observe that 7 · 2 = 14 ≡−1 (mod 15). From this, we deduce that 7 · (−2) = −14 ≡1 (mod 15). Thus, 7−1 ≡−2 ≡13 (mod 15). Example 29.1.14. Find x ∈Z such that 7x ≡1 (mod 31). We want to find x such that 7x = 31ℓ+ 1 for some ℓ∈Z. We can see that 7 ∤(31 · 1 + 1) but 7 | (31 · 2 + 1). Hence, 7 · 9 = 63 ≡1 (mod 31). This implies that 7−1 ≡9 (mod 31).", "output": "Think about what proof technique would work best here: direct proof, contrapositive, or contradiction?", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

Modular Arithmetic 30.1.1. Order of an Element Modulo m In this section, we introduce the order of an element modulo m and some key related theorems: Fermat’s Little Theorem and Euler’s Theorem. We begin with an important existence result. Theorem 30.1.1. Let m ∈Z+ and a ∈Z be relatively prime to m. Then there exists a positive integer n such that an ≡1 (mod m). Proof. Consider the following m + 1 integers: a1, a2, a3, . . . , am, am+1. Since |Z/mZ|= m, the Pigeonhole Principle implies that there exist distinct integers k, ℓ with ak ≡aℓ(mod m). Without loss of generality, assume k > ℓ. Multiplying both sides by (a−1)ℓgives ak−ℓ≡1 (mod m). Hence, n = k −ℓ∈Z+ satisfies the desired property. Once such an integer n is found satisfying an ≡1 (mod m), we can immediately determine a multiplicative inverse of a modulo m. Corollary 30.1.2. Let m ∈Z+ and a ∈Z be relatively prime to m. If n ∈Z+ satisfies an ≡1 (mod m), then a−1 ≡an−1 (mod m). The theorem guarantees that whenever a is relatively prime to m, there exists some positive integer n for which an ≡1 (mod m). We now define the smallest such n. 187\n\n Definition. Let m ∈Z+ and a ∈Z be relatively prime to m. The order of a modulo m, denoted ordm(a), is the smallest positive integer n such that an ≡1 (mod m). Example 30.1.3. To determine ord5(2), compute successive powers of 2 modulo 5: 21 ≡2 (mod 5), 22 ≡4 ≡−1 (mod 5), 23 ≡8 ≡3 (mod 5), 24 ≡16 ≡1 (mod 5). Since 4 is the smallest positive integer such that 2n ≡1 (mod 5), we conclude that ord5(2) = 4. There are infinitely many other values of n such that 2n ≡1 (mod 5): 28 ≡1 (mod 5), 212 ≡1 (mod 5), and in general, 24k ≡1 (mod 5) for all k ≥1. Fermat’s Little Theorem When the modulus is prime, any integer not divisible by it is coprime to the modulus, giving the following result. Theorem 30.1.4 (Fermat’s Little Theorem). If p is a prime number and a ∈Z is coprime to p, then ap−1 ≡1 (mod p). Proof. Let p be a prime and a ∈Z be coprime to p. For any i, j ∈{0, 1, 2, . . . , p −1}, we have ai ≡aj (mod p) if and only if i ≡j (mod p) by the Cancellation Law, since gcd(a, p) = 1. Thus, {0, 1, 2, . . . , p −1} and the set {0, a, 2a, . . . , (p −1)a} form a complete residue system modulo p. Removing 0 from each set, we have that the sets {1, 2, . . . , p−1} and {a, 2a, . . . , (p−1)a} represent the same set of residues modulo p, possibly in a different order. This yields the following congruence a · (2a) · · · (p −1)a ≡1 · 2 · · · (p −1) (mod p), 188\n\n which can be rewritten as ap−1(1 · 2 · · · (p −1)) ≡1 · 2 · · · (p −1) (mod p). Since p is prime, gcd(i, p) = 1 for each i ̸≡0 (mod p), and we can cancel these terms from both sides to conclude that ap−1 ≡1 (mod p). Corollary 30.1.5. Let p be a prime and a ∈Z. 1. If gcd(a, p) = 1, then ordp(a) | p −1. 2. ap ≡a (mod p) (even if a is not coprime to p).", "output": "Try to express this using set notation and apply the relevant set operations or identities.", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

Examples 30.1.10. ϕ(3) = |{k ∈[3] | gcd(k, 3) = 1}|= |{1, 2}|= 2, ϕ(4) = |{k ∈[4] | gcd(k, 4) = 1}|= |{1, 3}|= 2, ϕ(5) = |{k ∈[5] | gcd(k, 5) = 1}|= |{1, 2, 3, 4}|= 4, ϕ(6) = |{k ∈[6] | gcd(k, 6) = 1}|= |{1, 5}|= 2, ϕ(7) = |{k ∈[7] | gcd(k, 7) = 1}|= |{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}|= 6. If the prime factorization of n is known, there is a useful formula for computing ϕ(n). This formula follows from the two lemmas below. Lemma 30.1.11. If p is a prime number and a ∈Z+, then ϕ(pa) = pa −pa−1. Proof. Let p, a ∈Z+ with p prime. Since the only prime factor of pa is p, for any n ∈Z, gcd(n, pa) ̸= 1 if and only if p | n. We use this observation in the following chain of equalities. ϕ(pa) = |{m ∈Z | 1 ≤m ≤pa ∧gcd(m, pa) = 1}| = pa −|{m ∈Z | 1 ≤m ≤pa ∧p | m}| = pa −|{kp | 1 ≤k ≤pa−1}| = pa −pa−1. Lemma 30.1.12. If a, b ∈Z+ are coprime, then ϕ(ab) = ϕ(a)ϕ(b). Proof. You will prove this in your homework. Combining Lemmas 30.1.11 and 30.1.12, we get a formula for computing ϕ(n) for any positive integer n. 190\n\n Euler’s Totient Formula Let n ∈Z+ have canonical prime factorization n = pn1 1 pn2 2 · · · pnk k .

Order of an Element Modulo m Euler’s Theorem Now that we have Euler’s totient function, we can state and prove the analogue to Fermat’s Little Theorem. Theorem 31.1.1 (Euler’s Theorem). If m ∈Z+ and a ∈Z is coprime to m, then aϕ(m) ≡1 (mod m). The proof follows similarly to the proof of Fermat’s Little Theorem. Proof. Let {r1, r2, . . . , rϕ(m)} be a set of distinct residues coprime to m, called a reduced residue system modulo m. Since gcd(a, m) = 1 and gcd(ri, m) = 1 for each 1 ≤i ≤ϕ(m), we have gcd(ari, m) = 1 for each 1 ≤i ≤ϕ(m). Then, by the Cancellation Law and the fact that the ri’s are distinct modulo m, we have ari ≡arj (mod m) ⇐⇒ri ≡rj (mod m) ⇐⇒i = j. Therefore, {ar1, ar2, . . . , arϕ(m)} is also a reduced residue system modulo m. Thus, ϕ(m) Y i=1 ari ≡ ϕ(m) Y i=1 ri (mod m). Applying the Cancellation Law to each ri in the product yields aϕ(m) ≡1 (mod m), as desired. 192\n\n Definition. For m ∈Z+, a reduced residue system modulo m is a set of ϕ(m)- many integers such that each element is relatively prime to m, and no two different elements of the set are congruent modulo m. We have corollaries similar to those from Fermat’s Little Theorem. Corollaries 31.1.2. Let m ∈Z+ and a ∈Z. 1. If gcd(a, m) = 1, then ordm(a) | ϕ(m). 2. If gcd(a, m) = 1, then a−1 ≡aϕ(m)−1 (mod m). Example 31.1.3. Consider m = 18 = 2·32. Then ϕ(18) = ϕ(2)ϕ(32) = (2−1)·(9−3) = 6. Thus, there are 6 values of n with 0 ≤n ≤17 that are coprime to 18. These values form a reduced residue system: {1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17}. Each of these elements has an order (since they are coprime to 18), and their orders must divide 6. We proceed to find each of their orders: ord18(1) = 1, ord18(5) = 6, ord18(7) = 3, ord18(11) = 6, ord18(13) = 3, ord18(17) = 2.", "output": "Think about what proof technique would work best here: direct proof, contrapositive, or contradiction?", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

The Chinese Remainder Theorem The Chinese Remainder Theorem is one of the most celebrated and widely applicable results in number theory. In its simplest form, it addresses how to find integers that satisfy multiple congruence conditions with different moduli. Beyond its theoretical importance, it has applications across many areas of mathematics and computer science, and it admits numerous generalizations. Versions of this theorem were known in China as early as the 3rd century CE, where it was used to solve calendar and remainder problems, hence the name. Examples 31.1.11. 1. Find all x ∈Z such that x ≡3 (mod 5), x ≡2 (mod 3), and x ≡1 (mod 2). 2. Find all x ∈Z such that x2 ≡1 (mod 21). 194\n\n Theorem 31.1.12 (Chinese Remainder Theorem). Let m1, m2, . . . , mr ∈Z+ be pairwise relatively prime. Let a1, a2, . . . , ar ∈Z. The system of linear congruences x ≡a1 (mod m1) x ≡a2 (mod m2) ... x ≡ar (mod mr) has a unique solution modulo M = m1m2 · · · mr. There are several ways to prove this theorem, but an inductive argument is both natural and illustrative of how we actually solve systems of congruences in practice. Proof. We proceed by induction on the integer r ≥2. • Base case: r = 2. Let a1, a2 ∈Z and m1, m2 ∈Z+ with gcd(m1, m2) = 1. Consider the system of congruences x ≡a1 (mod m1) x ≡a2 (mod m2) Let x ∈Z satisfy x ≡a1 (mod m1). This is equivalent to the existence of some integer y1 such that x = m1y1 + a1. Fix y1. We now seek conditions on x that ensure x ≡a2 (mod m2). Since gcd(m1, m2) = 1, there exists n1 ∈Z such that m1n1 ≡1 (mod m2) by the MIRP Theorem (29.1.8). Fix such an n1. We then have the following logical equivalences: x ≡a2 (mod m2) ⇔m1y1 + a1 ≡a2 (mod m2) ⇔m1y1 ≡a2 −a1 (mod m2) ⇔y1 ≡n1(a2 −a1) (mod m2) ⇔y1 = n1(a2 −a1) + m2y2 for some y2 ∈Z ⇔x = m1n1(a2 −a1) + m1m2y2 + a1 for some y2 ∈Z ⇔x ≡m1n1(a2 −a1) + a1 (mod m1m2) Thus, x = m1n1(a2 −a1) + a1 is a solution to the system of congruences, and any solution must be congruent to this expression modulo m1m2. Therefore, the system of congruences has a unique solution modulo m1m2, as required. 195\n\n It is worth checking that x = m1n1(a2−a1)+a1 actually solves this system. When working modulo m1, we have x = m1n1(a2 −a1) + a1 ≡0 + a1 ≡a1 (mod m1) Working modulo m2, using m1n1 ≡1 (mod m2), we have x = m1n1(a2 −a1) + a1 ≡1 · (a2 −a1) + a1 ≡a2 (mod m2) • Inductive step: Let r ≥2 and assume the Chinese Remainder Theorem holds for any system of r congruences with pairwise relatively prime moduli. Let a1, . . . , ar, ar+1 ∈ Z and m1, . . . , mr, mr+1 ∈Z+ with the mi’s pairwise relatively prime. Consider the following system of (r + 1) congruences: x ≡a1 (mod m1) ... x ≡ar (mod mr) x ≡ar+1 (mod mr+1) By the inductive hypothesis, there exists a unique solution s ∈Z to the first r congruences modulo Qr i=1 mi. Our system now reduces to x ≡s (mod r Y i=1 mi) x ≡ar+1 (mod mr+1) Since gcd (Qr i=1 mi, mr+1) = 1, the moduli in this reduced system are relatively prime. By the base case, there is a unique solution modulo M = Qr+1 i=1 mi, completing the proof. By the Principle of Mathematical Induction, the Chinese Remainder Theorem holds for any integer r ≥2. Example 31.1.13. Find all integers x which satisfy the following system of congruences: x ≡1 (mod 2) x ≡2 (mod 3) x ≡3 (mod 5) By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there is a unique solution modulo 30 = 2 · 3 · 5. Suppose x is a solution to the system. We start with the largest modulus and work down to find x up to congruence modulo 30. 196\n\n • Since x ≡3 (mod 5), we have x = 5k + 3 for some k ∈Z. • Since x ≡2 (mod 3), we substitute to get 5k + 3 ≡2 (mod 3), which implies 2k ≡2 (mod 3). Thus, k ≡1 (mod 3), so k = 3ℓ+ 1 for some ℓ∈Z. Plugging this in, we get x = 5(3ℓ+ 1) + 3 = 15ℓ+ 8. • Since x ≡1 (mod 2), we substitute to get 15ℓ+ 8 ≡1 (mod 2), so x = 30m + 23 for m ∈Z. Thus, x ≡23 (mod 30) is the unique solution modulo 30. Example 31.1.14. Find all x ∈Z such that x2 ≡1 (mod 21).", "output": "Consider using mathematical induction.

Introduction Combinatorics, often called enumerative combinatorics in its simplest form, is the study of counting finite sets. While counting might sound straightforward, answering questions such as “How many elements have property X?” can quickly become complex and requires precise techniques. Historically, combinatorics originated in recreational mathematics and games-for example, in questions like “In how many ways can one deal a full house in poker?” Today, however, it is a foundational area of mathematics with applications across pure and applied mathematics, computer science, the natural sciences, and the social sciences. Its principles are especially useful in computer science for algorithm analysis and optimization, and in probability theory for computing event likelihoods. Combinatorics provides tools not only for counting and arranging objects but also for analyzing the structure and relationships among sets. The field has evolved to include a wide range of methods, from elementary counting techniques to more advanced approaches involving algebra and geometry, leading to insights across many areas of study. 32.2. Basic Counting Principles We begin by formalizing a few basic counting principles that may feel intuitive but are essential for a rigorous approach to combinatorics. Although these properties may seem obvious, stating them precisely will establish a foundation for more advanced counting techniques. 32.2.1. The Rule of Sum (Addition Principle) To state this theorem, we first define a slightly relaxed notion of a partition for finite sets (specific to combinatorics) that allows parts to be empty. 201\n\n Definition. Let A be a finite set. A collection of subsets {Ai}i∈I is called a partition of A if and only if [ i∈I Ai = A and Ai ∩Aj = ∅for all i ̸= j. Theorem 32.2.1 (Rule of Sum). If A is a finite set and F = {A1, . . . , Am} is a finite partition of A, then |A|= m X i=1 |Ai|= |A1|+|A2|+ · · · + |Am|. This rule is intuitive, as illustrated by the following example. Example 32.2.2. Let A be the set of possible entr´ees at a restaurant. We can partition A into subsets A1 and A2, where A1 = the set of entrees marked as spicy A2 = the set of entrees not marked as spicy If |A1|= 13 and |A2|= 20 then |A|= 33 by the Rule of Sum. The proof of this theorem follows immediately from Lemma 21.2.6 in the section on Cardinality.", "output": "Is this a permutation or combination problem? Consider whether order matters and whether repetition is allowed.", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}
{"instruction": "Give me a hint for solving the following problem.", "input": "Let A be a finite subset and A1 ⊆A. Use the Rule of Sum to prove that |A ∖A1|= |A|−|A1|. The previous exercise leads to the following corollary. Corollary 32.2.4 (Rule of Difference). If A is a finite set and A1 ⊆A, then |A ∖A1|= |A|−|A1|. Before our next corollary, we first define an n-to-1 surjection. 202\n\n Definition. A function f : A →B is called an n-to-1 surjection if and only if f is surjective and each b ∈B has exactly n preimages in A; that is, |PreImf({b})|= n. In other words, every element of the codomain is mapped to by exactly n elements of the domain. Corollary 32.2.5 (Rule of Division). Let A and B be finite sets, and let f : A →B be an n-to-1 surjection. Then |B|= |A| n . “To count the number of cows in a field, first count the number of legs and then divide by 4.” Proof. Let B = {b1, b2, . . . , bk}. Then A = PreImf({b1}) ∪PreImf({b2}) ∪· · · ∪PreImf({bk}) where |PreImf({bi})|= n for each i. Then, the Rule of Sum implies |A|= n + n + · · · + n | {z } k times = nk = n|B|. 32.2.2. The Rule of Product (Multiplication Principle) Theorem 32.2.6 (Rule of Product). Let n ∈Z+ and let Ai be a finite set for each i ∈[n]. If A = A1 × A2 × · · · × An, then |A|= n Y i=1 |Ai|. This principle is intuitive, as illustrated by the following example. Example 32.2.7. Let A be the set of all possible meals that can be ordered at a restaurant where each meal consists of one appetizer, one entr´ee, and one dessert. Define A1 = the set of possible appetizers, A2 = the set of possible entr´ees, A3 = the set of possible desserts. 203\n\n We can view A as A = A1 × A2 × A3. If |A1|= 5, |A2|= 10, and |A3|= 6, then by the Rule of Product, |A|= 5 · 10 · 6 = 300. To formally prove this theorem, we can rely on results already discussed in the section on cardinality. Sketch of Proof. If Ai = ∅for any i, then |A|= 0 and Qn i=1|Ai|= 0. Otherwise, assume each Ai is nonempty and proceed by induction on n ∈Z+. The base case n = 1 is trivial, and for n = 2, we have shown that if |A1|= k and |A2|= ℓ, then |A1 ×A2|= kℓ. The general inductive step follows in a similar manner. The following restatement aligns more closely with how the Rule of Product is applied in practice. Theorem 32.2.8 (Rule of Product, Reformulated). Suppose that the elements of a set are constructed by making a sequence of k choices such that: (i) The i-th choice can be made in ri ways, independently of previous choices. (ii) Each element in the set is uniquely determined by this sequence of choices. Then the total number of elements in the set is given by Qk i=1 ri. Returning to our restaurant example, each possible meal results from a sequence of three independent choices: there are 5 choices for an appetizer, 10 choices for an entr´ee (regardless of the appetizer), and 6 choices for a dessert (regardless of prior selections). Thus, there are 5·10·6 = 300 possible meals, each uniquely determined by one sequence of choices. A Combined Example Using Rules of Sum and Product Example 32.2.9. How many strings of lowercase English letters are there of length 4 or less (including the empty string)? Let A be the set of all such strings. We can partition A by length: {A0, A1, A2, A3, A4}, where A0 = the set of strings of length 0, A1 = the set of strings of length 1, A2 = the set of strings of length 2, A3 = the set of strings of length 3, A4 = the set of strings of length 4. 204\n\n By the Rule of Sum, |A|= |A0|+|A1|+|A2|+|A3|+|A4|. Let S be the set of lowercase English letters, so |S|= 26. Applying the Rule of Product, we find |A0| = 1, |A1| = 26, |A2| = 262, |A3| = 263, |A4| = 264. Therefore, |A|= 1 + 26 + 262 + 263 + 264 = 475,255. A Combined Example Using Rules of Product and Division Example 32.2.10.

The Pigeonhole Principle Recall that we introduced the Pigeonhole Principle (Theorem 6.1.2) informally earlier in the semester. Below is a more formal statement, along with a proof. Theorem 32.2.16 (Pigeonhole Principle). Let A be a finite set partitioned into parts A1, . . . , Ak for some k ∈Z+. If |A|= n, then there exists i ∈[k] such that |Ai|≥ ln k m . In particular, if n > k, then there exists i ∈[k] such that |Ai|> 1. “If many pigeons are placed into too few pigeonholes, at least one pigeonhole will contain multiple pigeons.” Proof. Let A be partitioned into the sets {A1, . . . , Ak}. Assume, for contradiction, that |Ai|< n k for each i ∈[k]. Then, by the Rule of Sum, |A|= k X i=1 |Ai|< k X i=1 n k = n, which contradicts the assumption that |A|= n. Therefore, there must exist some i ∈[k] such that |Ai|≥ \u0006 n k \u0007 . 206\n\n Example 32.2.17. Suppose 75 students attended lecture today. The Pigeonhole Principle implies that there must be at least \u001875 12 \u0019 = 7 students who share the same birth month. Why? If each month contained at most 6 students’ birthdays, then the total number of students would be 6 · 12 = 72, contradicting the assumption of 75 students. Example 32.2.18. A standard deck of 52 playing cards has 4 distinct suits (spades, clubs, hearts, diamonds) and 13 ranks for each suit (2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K,A). How many cards must be selected to guarantee at least 3 cards of a single suit? The Pigeonhole Principle tells us to find the smallest integer n such that ln 4 m = 3. Thus, n = 2 · 4 + 1 = 9, so we must select at least 9 cards to guarantee at least 3 cards of a single suit. The Pigeonhole Principle is one of the simplest yet most powerful theorems in mathematics and often yields surprising results. Example 32.2.19 (Friends and Strangers Theorem). Suppose a party has six people. Consider any two of them: they are either meeting for the first time (mutual strangers) or already know each other (mutual acquaintances). The theorem states: “In any party of six people, at least three of them are (pairwise) mutual strangers or mutual acquaintances.” Proof. Label the six people as {a, b, c, d, e, f}. Consider person a and let A be the set of acquaintances of a, and S be the set of strangers to a. Then {A, S} partitions {b, c, d, e, f}. Since |A|+|S|= 5, the Pigeonhole Principle implies that at least one of A or S has at least 3 people. • Case 1: |A|≥3. All people in A are acquaintances with a. If any two in A are acquainted, they form a group of 3 mutual acquaintances with a. Otherwise, if no two people in A know each other, then A is a group of 3 mutual strangers. • Case 2: |S|≥3. All people in S are strangers to a. If any two in S are strangers to each other, they form a group of 3 mutual strangers with a. Otherwise, if all people in S know each other, then S is a group of 3 mutual acquaintances. 207\n\n This theorem can also be interpreted using a complete graph with 6 vertices: It states that if all edges are colored either red or blue, a monochromatic triangle is guaranteed.

The Principle of Double Counting If we count the size of a set in two different ways, then both expressions for the cardinality of the set must be equal. This principle, known as double counting, often reveals interesting combinatorial identities. Example 33.1.1 (The Handshake Lemma). Suppose there are n people at a party, and everyone shakes hands with everyone else exactly once. How many handshakes occur in total? • Method 1: Each of the n people shakes hands with n −1 others. Counting all handshakes in this way gives n(n −1), but each handshake is counted twice (once for each participant). Thus, we divide by 2 to obtain the total number of unique handshakes: n(n −1) 2 . • Method 2: Number the n people from 1 to n. To avoid double counting, consider only the handshakes each person makes with those numbered lower than themselves. Let Ai denote the set of handshakes made by person i with people numbered below i. Since person i has i −1 such handshakes, we find |A|= n X i=1 |Ai|= n X i=1 (i −1) = n−1 X j=1 j. Since both expressions describe the total number of handshakes, they must be equal. Therefore, n(n −1) 2 = n−1 X j=1 j. This equality coincides with the formula for the sum of the first n −1 positive integers, which we previously proved by induction. The argument above illustrates a counting in two ways proof. We will encounter additional examples of this technique throughout the remainder of these notes. 209\n\n We now wish to discuss some additional combinatorial methods. Most counting problems that we encounter fall into one of four categories: arrangements without repetition, arrangements with repetition, selections without repetition, and selections with repetition. 33.2. Arrangements and Selections 33.2.1. Ordered Arrangements/Permutations Definition. Let n, k ∈N with n ≥k, and let X be a set with |X|= n. A karrangement of X is an injection f : [k] →X. Arrangements appear frequently in combinatorics, and several equivalent descriptions are used in practice. For example, a string of distinct letters is an arrangement: the positions in the string form the domain, and the chosen letters form the codomain. M A T H is a 4-arrangement of the alphabet (a string of length 4 with no repeated letters). Similarly, a finite sequence or ordered n-tuple with no repeated entries is an arrangement. The 5-tuple (1, 2, 3, 5, 8) is a 5-arrangement. Counting the number of k-arrangements of a set of size n is a straightforward application of the Rule of Product. Theorem 33.2.1. Let n, k ∈Z+ with n ≥k, and let X be a set with |X|= n. Then the number of k-arrangements from X is given by n · (n −1) · · · (n −k + 1) = k−1 Y i=0 (n −i) = n! (n −k)!. Proof. Without loss of generality, we may assume X = [n]. Let P(n, k) denote the set of k-arrangements of [n]. We construct an arbitrary f ∈P(n, k) through the following k-step procedure: • Choose f(1): there are n options. • Choose f(2), distinct from f(1): there are n −1 options. • In general, at step i, there are n −(i −1) options for f(i). 210\n\n After step k, the function f is completely determined. Each arrangement is produced by exactly one such sequence of choices, so by the Rule of Product, |P(n, k)|= k Y i=1 (n −(i −1)) = k−1 Y i=0 (n −i) = n! (n −k)!. We illustrate with a simple example. Example 33.2.2. Out of a group of 20 contestants, we must select first, second, and third place. How many possible outcomes are there? Let X be the set of contestants. This is equivalent to counting the number of injections f : [3] ,→X, since the three places must be assigned to three distinct contestants. Alternatively, we can view this as filling three ordered positions: 1st 2nd 3rd By the Rule of Product, there are 20 choices for 1st, 19 choices for 2nd, 18 choices for 3rd. 20 1st 19 2nd 18 3rd Thus the total number of possible outcomes is 20 · 19 · 18 = 20! 17! = 6840 . The most important special case is when k = n, which yields the notion of a permutation. Definition. Let n ∈Z+ and let X be a finite set with |X|= n. A permutation of X is a bijection f : [n] →X. Equivalently, a permutation is a string or ordered n-tuple containing each element of X exactly once. Notation: Given a set X, we denote the set of permutations of X by Sym(X). When X = [n], we write Sn. 211\n\n Example 33.2.3. Let S = {a, b, c}. • Examples of permutations of S: (a, b, c), (b, a, c), (c, b, a). • Non-examples: (b, b, a) (repetition), (a, c) (not all elements used). The permutation (b, a, c) can equivalently be viewed as the bijection f : [3] →S defined by f(1) = b, f(2) = a, and f(3) = c. Since a permutation is simply an n-arrangement of an n-element set, the previous theorem immediately yields the following corollary. Corollary 33.2.4. Let n ∈Z+ and let X be a set with |X|= n. Then there are n! permutations on X. We next consider arrangements where repetition is allowed. Definition. Let n, k ∈Z+ and let X be a set with |X|= n. A k-arrangement with repetition from X is a function f : [k] →X. Equivalently, it is an ordered k-tuple whose entries lie in X, and repetitions are permitted. Let T(n, k) denote the set of k-arrangements with repetition from [n]. Since each of the k positions has n independent choices, the Rule of Product gives |T(n, k)|= |[n]k|= nk. We record this as a theorem for convenience. Theorem 33.2.5. For any n, k ∈Z+, the number of k-arrangements with repetition from a set of size n is nk. Example 33.2.6. Determine the number of binary strings of length 10. A binary string of length 10 is a 10-arrangement with repetition from {0, 1}. Thus the number of such strings is |T(2, 10)|= 210 = 1024. 33.2.2. Selections/Combinations Selections are similar to arrangements, except order does not matter. Definition. Let n, k ∈N with k ≤n, and let X be a set with |X|= n. A k-selection from X is a subset of X of size k. 212\n\n Notation: We write \u0000n k \u0001 for the number of k-selections from [n]. This is called the binomial coefficient and is read as “n choose k.” If k < 0 or k > n, we define \u0000n k \u0001 = 0. For 0 ≤k ≤n, the following theorem provides a formula to compute \u0000n k \u0001 . Theorem 33.2.7. Let n, k ∈N with k ≤n. Then \u0000n k \u0001 = n! k!(n−k)!. Proof. Let P(n, k) be the set of all k-arrangements from [n]. We count |P(n, k)| in two different ways. 1. By our previous result, we know that |P(n, k)|= n! (n−k)!. 2. Alternatively, we can build a k-arrangement in two steps: • First choose the underlying k elements. There are \u0000n k \u0001 ways to choose a ksubset of [n]. • Then arrange these k elements in order, which can be done in k! ways. By the Rule of Product, we conclude that |P(n, k)|= k! \u0000n k \u0001 . Equating the two expressions for |P(n, k)| gives n! (n −k)! = k! \u0012n k \u0013 . Solving for \u0000n k \u0001 completes the proof: \u0012n k \u0013 = n! k! (n −k)!. Corollary 33.2.8. For n, k ∈N with 0 ≤k ≤n, \u0012n k \u0013 = \u0012 n n −k \u0013 . Example 33.2.9.

November 21 34.1. Counting Arguments Before developing more theory, we will pause to look at some examples that apply the counting principles we have established so far. 34.1.1. Poker Hands A common example in introductory combinatorics or discrete probability is counting poker hands. We will use a standard deck of 52 playing cards (4 suits, each with 13 ranks), but no prior knowledge of poker is required; any poker-specific details will be provided as needed. Example 34.1.1. How many 5-card poker hands are One Pair hands? A One Pair hand consists of 2 cards of one rank and 3 additional cards, each of distinct ranks different from the pair and different from one another (so the hand is neither a three-of-a-kind nor a two-pair). We can use a multi-step Rule of Product approach to ensure that each one-pair hand is constructed in exactly one way and that no invalid hands are counted. Rule of Product procedure: • Choose the rank of the pair: \u000013 1 \u0001 = 13 choices. • From that rank, choose 2 suits: \u00004 2 \u0001 choices. • Choose 3 additional ranks (all distinct and all different from the paired rank): \u000012 3 \u0001 choices. • For each of these 3 ranks, choose a suit: \u00004 1 \u00013 = 43 choices. By the Rule of Product, the total number of one-pair hands is: Total = \u001213 1 \u0013 · \u00124 2 \u0013 · \u001212 3 \u0013 · 43 = 1, 098, 240 Answer: 1,098,240 one-pair hands. 216\n\n If you used a different Rule-of-Product approach, that is perfectly fine. The final count will be the same, though there are several valid ways to construct the set. Here is one alternative method: Alternative procedure: • Select 4 distinct ranks to appear in the hand: \u000013 4 \u0001 choices. • From these 4 ranks, choose 1 to be the rank of the pair: \u00004 1 \u0001 choices. • For this rank, choose 2 suits: \u00004 2 \u0001 choices. • For each of the 3 remaining ranks, choose a suit: \u00004 1 \u00013 = 43 choices. Applying the Rule of Product again yields Total = \u001213 4 \u0013 · \u00124 1 \u0013 · \u00124 2 \u0013 · 43 = 1, 098, 240 Answer: 1,098,240 one-pair hands. Let us try another example involving poker hands. Example 34.1.2. A 5-card poker hand is called a Full House if it consists of 3 cards of one rank and 2 cards of another rank (that is, a three-of-a-kind together with a pair). How many distinct Full House hands are possible? Rule of Product procedure: • Choose the two ranks that will appear in the hand: \u000013 2 \u0001 choices. • From these two ranks, choose the rank of the three-of-a-kind: \u00002 1 \u0001 = 2 choices. • For that rank, choose 3 suits: \u00004 3 \u0001 choices. • For the remaining rank, choose 2 suits: \u00004 2 \u0001 choices. Thus, by the Rule of Product, the number of Full House hands is Total = \u001213 2 \u0013 · \u00122 1 \u0013 · \u00124 3 \u0013 · \u00124 2 \u0013 = 3,744. Answer: 3,744 Full House hands.", "output": "Is this a permutation or combination problem?

{"instruction": "Give me a hint for solving the following problem.", "input": "A Three-of-a-Kind is a 5-card hand that contains 3 cards of one rank, with the remaining 2 cards each of different ranks, distinct from the three-of-a-kind and from each other (that is, not a Full House and not a Four-of-a-Kind). How many distinct Three-of-a-Kind hands are possible? 217\n\n 34.1.2. Binary n-tuples A common example in combinatorics involves counting subsets of binary n-tuples. Many combinatorial arguments can be phrased in terms of binary n-tuples (as you may have seen in recitation). We will find these useful for our discussion of selections with repetition. Example 34.1.4. For n ∈Z+, recall that {0, 1}n denotes the set of binary n-tuples. Let n ≥3. How many binary n-tuples are there that contain at least three 1’s? In many counting problems, it is easier to determine the size of the complement of a set rather than counting the set directly. Here, instead of counting all binary n-tuples with exactly three 1’s, four 1’s, . . . , up to n 1’s, it is simpler to count the number with zero, one, or two 1’s and subtract this from the total number of binary n-tuples. Define S = {0, 1}n. First, note that |S|= 2n since each component has two choices, 0 or 1. We now calculate the number of binary n-tuples with fewer than three 1’s. For each i ∈{0, 1, 2}, let Ai denote the subset of binary n-tuples that contain exactly i many 1’s. • |A0|= \u0000n 0 \u0001 = 1, because a binary n-tuple with no 1’s must be the tuple (0, 0, . . . , 0). • |A1|= \u0000n 1 \u0001 = n. Here we choose which one of the n components is 1; all remaining components are 0. • |A2|= \u0000n 2 \u0001 = n(n−1) 2 . We select two of the n components to be 1’s; all remaining components are 0. Since the sets A0, A1, A2 are pairwise disjoint, the Rule of Difference gives |S \\ (A0 ∪A1 ∪A2)|= 2n − \u0012n 0 \u0013 − \u0012n 1 \u0013 − \u0012n 2 \u0013 Thus, there are 2n − \u0000n 0 \u0001 − \u0000n 1 \u0001 − \u0000n 2 \u0001 binary n-tuples with at least three 1’s. Later, when we introduce the Principle of Inclusion–Exclusion, we will see how to handle complements when the relevant sets are not disjoint. This example motivates the following proposition. Proposition 34.1.5. For all n ∈N, 2n = nP i=0 \u0000n i \u0001 . Below we present another example of a counting in two ways argument, using the Principle of Double Counting. 218\n\n Proof. Let n ∈N, and consider the set S = {0, 1}n of binary n-tuples. If n = 0, the only element of S is the empty string, so |S|= 20 = 1. For n ≥1, |S|= 2n by the arrangements-with-repetition formula, since each of the n components has two choices. Alternatively, we can count |S| by partitioning S as {Si | 0 ≤i ≤n}, where Si is the set of binary n-tuples with exactly i components equal to 1. Observe that if i ̸= j, then Si ∩Sj = ∅, because no binary n-tuple can have both i and j components equal to 1. Furthermore, n[ i=0 Si = S, since every binary n-tuple has between 0 and n entries equal to 1. Thus, {Si | 0 ≤i ≤n} is a partition of S. For each i ∈{0, 1, . . . , n}, we have |Si|= \u0000n i \u0001 , since forming such a tuple amounts to choosing which i of the n components are 1’s. Using the Rule of Sum, |S|= n X i=0 |Si|= n X i=0 \u0012n i \u0013 . Equating the two expressions for |S| yields 2n = n X i=0 \u0012n i \u0013 .", "output": "Consider using mathematical induction.

Counting in Two Ways Proofs We have now seen several examples of proofs using the principle of double counting. This proof technique has several advantages. First, it is sometimes difficult to establish an equality algebraically, while a combinatorial proof may be far more transparent. Second, even when an identity can be proved algebraically or by induction, those methods may obscure the underlying combinatorial idea. Counting in two ways often reveals why the equality is true by highlighting the processes being counted. Below is a basic template for a “counting in two ways” proof. Counting in Two Ways Proof Template 1. Motivated by the expressions on both sides of the equation, define a set S whose cardinality you will compute in two ways. Make sure the definition of your set is clear. 2. Give a counting argument for |S| that yields the expression on the left-hand side of the equation. 3. Give a counting argument for |S| that yields the expression on the right-hand side of the equation. 4. Conclude that since both expressions count |S|, they must be equal. We now look at some standard examples of counting in two ways. 35.1.1. Pascal’s Triangle Many high school algebra courses introduce Pascal’s triangle as a tool for expanding binomials. If you have seen it before, you may recall that the entries on the sides are 1’s, and each entry inside the triangle is the sum of the two entries directly above it. Rows 0 through 5 are shown below. Although this is Pascal’s triangle, we can formally define it using binomial coefficients. Each entry is equal to \u0000n k \u0001 , where n is the row number and k is the position within the row. Both n and k start at 0, with 0 ≤k ≤n. 221\n\n n = 0: 1 n = 1: 1 1 n = 2: 1 2 1 n = 3: 1 3 3 1 n = 4: 1 4 6 4 1 n = 5: 1 5 10 10 5 1 Table 35.1.: Pascal’s Triangle Using this notation, Pascal’s triangle may be rewritten as in Table 35.2. \u00120 0 \u0013 \u00121 0 \u0013 \u00121 1 \u0013 \u00122 0 \u0013 \u00122 1 \u0013 \u00122 2 \u0013 \u00123 0 \u0013 \u00123 1 \u0013 \u00123 2 \u0013 \u00123 3 \u0013 \u00124 0 \u0013 \u00124 1 \u0013 \u00124 2 \u0013 \u00124 3 \u0013 \u00124 4 \u0013 \u00125 0 \u0013 \u00125 1 \u0013 \u00125 2 \u0013 \u00125 3 \u0013 \u00125 4 \u0013 \u00125 5 \u0013 Table 35.2.: Pascal’s Triangle We now show that this binomial coefficient description is equivalent to the recursive version in Table 35.1. In particular, we prove the following. Theorem 35.1.1 (Pascal’s Formula). For all n, k ∈Z+ with k ≤n, it holds that \u0000n k \u0001 = \u0000n−1 k \u0001 + \u0000n−1 k−1 \u0001 . This identity states that each binomial coefficient equals the sum of the two entries directly above it. We prove it using a counting in two ways argument. Proof. Motivated by the left-hand side, define S = {T ∈P([n]) | |T|= k}, the set of all k-element subsets of [n]. We compute |S| in two ways. 222\n\n • Left-hand side (LHS): By definition, |S|= \u0000n k \u0001 , since \u0000n k \u0001 represents the number of k-element subsets of a set with n-many elements. • Right-hand side (RHS): We partition S into subsets A and B defined as follows: A = {T ∈S | 1 ∈T}, B = {T ∈S | 1 /∈T}. Notice that S = A ∪B and A ∩B = ∅, so {A, B} forms a partition of S. We count |A| and |B| separately: ▶|A|= \u0000n−1 k−1 \u0001 , since each subset in A includes the element 1, leaving k −1 elements to be chosen from the remaining n −1 elements. ▶|B|= \u0000n−1 k \u0001 , since each subset in B is formed by choosing all k-elements from the set {2, 3, . . . , n}. By the Rule of Sum, we have |S|= |A|+|B|= \u0012n −1 k −1 \u0013 + \u0012n −1 k \u0013 . Equating our two expressions for |S| yields \u0000n k \u0001 = \u0000n−1 k−1 \u0001 + \u0000n−1 k \u0001 . There are many interesting patterns in Pascal’s triangle. For example, consider what happens when we sum the entries along a diagonal. 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 3 3 1 1 4 6 4 1 1 5 10 10 5 1 1 6 15 20 15 6 1 Table 35.3.: Summation Identity Summing the red entries along the diagonal produces the boxed red entry one row below and one position to the right. The same holds for the blue diagonal. This pattern persists throughout Pascal’s triangle. We now generalize this observation. 223\n\n Proposition 35.1.2 (Summation Identity). For all k, n ∈N, we have: n X i=0 \u0012i k \u0013 = \u0012n + 1 k + 1 \u0013 . Proof. Let k, n ∈N, and let S = {T ∈P([n + 1]) | |T|= k + 1}. We will compute |S| in two different ways. • Right-hand side: By definition, |S|= \u0000n+1 k+1 \u0001 . • Left-hand side: Partition S into subsets Si for i ∈[n] ∪{0} where Si = {T ∈S | (i + 1 ∈T) ∧∀j ∈T, j ≤i + 1}. Here, Si consists of all subsets T ∈S where the largest element is i + 1. Clearly, Si ∩Sj = ∅for i ̸= j, and since any T ∈S has a largest element between 1 and n + 1, we have Sn i=0 Si = S. Thus, {Si} is indeed a partition of S. For each 0 ≤i ≤n, |Si|= \u0000i k \u0001 , since there are \u0000i k \u0001 ways to select the remaining k elements of a subset of size k + 1 with i + 1 as the largest element. By the Rule of Sum, |S|= Pn i=0|Si|= Pn i=0 \u0000i k \u0001 . Therefore, \u0000n+1 k+1 \u0001 = Pn i=0 \u0000i k \u0001 . 35.1.2. The Binomial Theorem Before moving on to more examples of counting in two ways arguments, we record an important identity involving binomial coefficients. You will prove this theorem in recitation, but we state it here for later reference. Theorem 35.1.3 (Binomial Theorem). For all n ∈N and all real numbers x, y, we have (x + y)n = n X k=0 \u0012n k \u0013 x n−ky k. The coefficients in this expansion are exactly the entries that appear in Pascal’s triangle. In fact, if you list the coefficients of (x + y)n in order, you obtain the entire nth row of the triangle. This connection is one of the main reasons binomial coefficients play such a central role in counting. 224\n\n Examples 35.1.4. 1. Expanding a small power: (x + y)3 = \u00123 0 \u0013 x3 + \u00123 1 \u0013 x2y + \u00123 2 \u0013 xy2 + \u00123 3 \u0013 y3 = x3 + 3x2y + 3xy2 + y3. 2. Using the theorem to obtain coefficients: (2 −t)4 = 4 X k=0 \u00124 k \u0013 2 4−k(−t) k = 16 −32t + 24t2 −8t3 + t4. 3. Since the coefficients match Pascal’s triangle, we have (x + y)5 = x5 + 5x4y + 10x3y2 + 10x2y3 + 5xy4 + y5.

So far, we have been describing our sets as purely mathematical objects (e.g., the set of subsets of [n] of size k). As we begin to work with more complicated sets, a purely set-theoretic description can become difficult for the reader to follow. To address this, we introduce a helpful strategy for describing subsets and their elements in a more intuitive and accessible way. 35.1.3. New Strategy: Committees and Leaders This strategy is widely used in combinatorial proofs. For example, instead of referring directly to the set of subsets of [n] of size k, we can think of this set as the collection of all committees of size k chosen from n distinct people. By reducing the technical mathematical language, this approach helps highlight the underlying counting ideas. 225\n\n Example 35.1.6. Prove that for all k, n ∈Z+, k \u0012n k \u0013 = n \u0012n −1 k −1 \u0013 . Proof. Let k, n ∈Z+, and let S be the set of all k-person committees with a designated chairperson, formed from a group of n people. We will compute |S| in two different ways. • (LHS): Construct an element of S by the following procedure: ▶Choose a k-person committee from the n people. There are \u0000n k \u0001 ways to do this. ▶From the k committee members, select one person to serve as chair. There are k choices. By the Rule of Product, |S|= k \u0000n k \u0001 . • (RHS): Alternatively, construct an element of S as follows: ▶Choose the chairperson from among the n people. There are n choices. ▶From the remaining n−1 people, select k −1 additional committee members. There are \u0000n−1 k−1 \u0001 ways to do this. Again by the Rule of Product, |S|= n \u0000n−1 k−1 \u0001 . Since both procedures count the same set S, the two expressions for |S| must be equal. Therefore, k \u0012n k \u0013 = n \u0012n −1 k −1 \u0013 . Remark. The set S used in the proof above can also be described formally as S = {(T, t) ∈P([n]) × [n] : t ∈T, |T|= k}. Here, [n] represents the set of n people, T represents the committee, and t is the designated chairperson (a distinguished element of T). While this formal description is precise, describing the elements of S as “committees with leaders” often makes the combinatorial structure more transparent. The next exercise continues this idea with a small twist. Try to solve it on your own before reading further. 226", "output": "Think about what proof technique would work best here: direct proof, contrapositive, or contradiction?", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

Counting in Two Ways Proofs We now modify the previous example to explore another useful counting argument. The twist here is that we must keep track of two roles on each committee, and an important distinction will arise. Example 36.1.1. Prove that for all n ∈Z+, n X k=1 k2 \u0012n k \u0013 = n · 2n−1 + n(n −1) · 2n−2. Proof. Let n ∈Z+, and let S be the set of all nonempty committees formed from n people, where each committee has both a leader and a planner. The leader and planner may be the same person or two different people. Important note. When describing a set such as S, we must specify whether the two roles must be filled by distinct individuals. The counting changes significantly depending on whether overlap is allowed. A precise description of S is: S = {(T, k, ℓ) ∈P([n]) × [n] × [n] : k ∈T, ℓ∈T}, where T is the committee, k is the leader, and ℓis the planner. We now count |S| in two ways. • (LHS): Counting by committee size. Partition S into the subsets Sk, where Sk consists of committees of size k. To construct an element of Sk: ▶Choose the k-person committee: \u0000n k \u0001 choices. ▶Choose the leader from among the k committee members. ▶Choose the planner from among the k committee members. By the Rule of Product, |Sk|= k2\u0000n k \u0001 . Summing over all valid committee sizes gives |S|= n X k=1 k2 \u0012n k \u0013 . 228\n\n • (RHS): Counting by role assignments. Partition S into two subsets: A = committees where the leader and planner are the same person, B = committees where the leader and planner are distinct people. Counting A: ▶Choose the person who serves as both leader and planner: n choices. ▶Choose any (possibly empty) subset of the remaining n−1 people to complete the committee: 2 n−1 choices. By the rule of product, |A|= n · 2n−1. Counting B: ▶Choose the leader: n choices. ▶Choose the planner from the remaining n −1 people: n −1 choices. ▶From the remaining n−2 people, choose a (possibly empty) subset to complete the committee: 2 n−2 choices. By the rule of product, |B|= n(n −1) · 2n−2. By the Rule of Sum, |S|= |A|+|B|= n · 2n−1 + n(n −1) · 2n−2. Finally, equating our two expressions for |S| gives the desired identity: n X k=1 k2 \u0012n k \u0013 = n · 2n−1 + n(n −1) · 2n−2.", "output": "Consider using mathematical induction.

Selections with Repetition In this section, we address the question: With repetition allowed, how many ways are there to select n objects from k types of objects? To build intuition, we first examine a concrete example. Example 36.2.1. A donut shop sells 10 different flavors of donuts. You want to buy 12 donuts from the shop. How many distinct ways can you order these dozen donuts? This is a selection problem because the order in which the donuts are chosen does not matter. For example, selecting a glazed donut followed by a powdered donut is the same as selecting a powdered donut followed by a glazed donut. However, this is not a simple selection problem because choosing 2 glazed donuts is different from choosing 1 glazed donut in your box of 12. To visualize the situation, imagine organizing the 12 donuts by flavor: OO OOO · · · · · · · · · O Flavor 1 Flavor 2 · · · · · · · · · Flavor 10 Place an O above Flavor n (for 1 ≤n ≤10) for each donut of that flavor. To separate the flavors, insert dividers between groups. In total, the diagram contains 12 O’s (one for each donut) and 9 dividers (one fewer than the number of flavors). This arrangement corresponds to a binary string of length 12+10−1 = 21, consisting of 12 0’s (donuts) and 9 1’s (dividers). The number of possible arrangements is the number of ways to choose 12 positions for the 0’s (or equivalently, 9 positions for the 1’s): \u001221 12 \u0013 = \u001221 9 \u0013 = 293, 930. Thus, there are 293,930 distinct ways to buy a dozen donuts. This correspondence between selections with repetition and binary strings leads directly to the following general theorem. 230\n\n Theorem 36.2.2 (Stars and Bars). With repetition allowed, there are \u0000n+k−1 k−1 \u0001 = \u0000n+k−1 n \u0001 ways to select n objects from k types. Equivalently, this is the number of nonnegative integer solutions to the equation x1 + x2 + · · · + xk = n, for k, n ∈N. Note. This result is often referred to as the stars and bars theorem, a name derived from a visual mnemonic. The “stars” represent the objects being selected (e.g., donuts), while the “bars” divide the stars into k groups corresponding to the different object types. This terminology is widely used in combinatorics and can be helpful when recalling or visualizing the theorem. Example 36.2.3. Suppose we roll n indistinguishable six-sided dice. (a) How many different outcomes are possible? Since the dice are indistinguishable and each die shows a number from 1 to 6, this is a selection-with-repetition problem. For example, one outcome could be rolling three 2’s, two 3’s, and one 6, which we can represent as: OOO OO O 1 2 3 4 5 6 Here, the total number of outcomes is the number of ways to distribute n rolls among the six possible results: \u0012n + 5 5 \u0013 . (b) Assume n ≥12. How many outcomes are possible if at least 2 dice show each number? Begin by assigning 2 dice to each of the six faces, using up 12 rolls. The remaining n −12 rolls can be distributed arbitrarily among the six outcomes. By stars and bars, the total number of outcomes is: \u0012(n −12) + 5 5 \u0013 . Alternatively, we can frame this in terms of integer equations. We wish to count the number of solutions to x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 + x6 = n, xi ≥2. Letting yi = xi −2, we rewrite the equation as y1 + y2 + y3 + y4 + y5 + y6 = n −12, where yi ≥0. 231\n\n The number of nonnegative integer solutions is again \u0012(n −12) + 5 5 \u0013 . (c) In how many ways can we roll 20 dice with at most three 6’s? We present two different correct answers below: • Answer 1: Find the complement. How many ways can we roll the 20 dice with at least four 6’s? ▶Begin by assigning four dice to 6. ▶The remaining 16 dice can be assigned arbitrarily. By the Stars-and-Bars theorem, there are \u000021 5 \u0001 ways to roll the dice with at least four 6’s. Since there are \u000025 5 \u0001 outcomes possible with no restriction, we apply the Rule of Subtraction to get the number of outcomes with at most three 6’s: \u001225 5 \u0013 − \u001221 5 \u0013 possible outcomes • Answer 2: Find the number of solutions that satisfy x6 = k for 0 ≤k ≤3. For each k, assign exactly k dice to x6. The remaining 20 −k dice can be distributed arbitrarily among x1 through x5. Applying stars-and-bars, this can be done in \u0012(20 −k) + (5 −1) 5 −1 \u0013 = \u001224 −k 4 \u0013 ways Applying the Rule of Sum we have 3 X k=0 \u001224 −k 4 \u0013 = \u001224 4 \u0013 + \u001223 4 \u0013 + \u001222 4 \u0013 + \u001221 4 \u0013 possible outcomes. Note that the second answer could be rewritten as 24 X k=0 \u0012 k 24 \u0013 − 20 X k=0 \u0012k 4 \u0013 , and, by the Summation Identity, this equals \u000025 5 \u0001 − \u000021 5 \u0001 , the first answer we arrived at. 232\n\n 37. December 3 37.1. Selections with Repetition Example 37.1.1. Suppose we have 10 pirates who must divvy up 100 pieces of gold. Suppose further that Captains Redbeard and Blackbeard are among the 10 pirates. (a) How many ways are there to divvy up the 100 pieces of gold among the 10 pirates? We are distributing 100 objects (pieces of gold) among 10 types (individual pirates). Using the selections-with-repetition formula, this can be done in \u0012100 + 10 −1 10 −1 \u0013 = \u0012109 9 \u0013 = 4, 263, 421, 511, 271 different ways. (b) How many ways are there to divvy up the gold if exactly 2 pirates receive no gold? We can construct a division of gold with this property via a 3-step rule of product: • Determine which 2 pirates receive no gold. There are \u000010 2 \u0001 options. • Give one piece of gold to each of the remaining 8 pirates. This can be done in 1 way. • Distribute the remaining 92 pieces of gold among the 8 pirates. Using the selections-with-repetition formula, this can be done in \u001292 + 8 −1 8 −1 \u0013 = \u001299 7 \u0013 different ways. By the Rule of Product, there are \u001210 2 \u0013\u001299 7 \u0013 = 669, 916, 419, 480 distributions in which exactly 2 pirates receive no gold. 233\n\n (c) Suppose Redbeard must get at least 5 pieces of gold and Blackbeard must get at most 5 pieces of gold. How many ways are there to divvy up the gold with these restrictions? First, there are \u001295 + 10 −1 10 −1 \u0013 = \u0012104 9 \u0013 ways to distribute the gold so that Redbeard gets at least 5 pieces. This is determined by first giving Redbeard 5 pieces, then distributing the remaining 95 pieces among all 10 pirates using the selections-with-repetition formula. Next, there are \u001289 + 10 −1 10 −1 \u0013 = \u001298 9 \u0013 ways to distribute the gold so that Redbeard gets at least 5 pieces and Blackbeard gets more than 5 pieces (at least 6). This is done by first giving Redbeard 5 pieces, Blackbeard 6 pieces, and then distributing the remaining 89 pieces among all 10 pirates. Finally, by the Rule of Subtraction, the number of distributions in which Redbeard gets at least 5 pieces and Blackbeard gets at most 5 pieces is \u0012104 9 \u0013 − \u001298 9 \u0013 = 1,173,807,751,480. (d) How many ways are there to divvy up the gold if Redbeard gets at least 10 pieces of gold, but Blackbeard gets somewhere between 5 and 15 (inclusive) pieces of gold? First, there are \u001285 + 10 −1 10 −1 \u0013 = \u001294 9 \u0013 ways to distribute the gold so that Redbeard gets at least 10 pieces and Blackbeard gets at least 5 pieces. This is done by first giving Redbeard 10 pieces and Blackbeard 5 pieces, then distributing the remaining 85 pieces among all 10 pirates. Next, there are \u001274 + 9 9 \u0013 = \u001283 9 \u0013 ways to distribute the gold so that Redbeard gets at least 10 pieces and Blackbeard gets more than 15 pieces (at least 16). 234\n\n By the Rule of Subtraction, the number of distributions in which Redbeard gets at least 10 pieces and Blackbeard gets between 5 and 15 pieces (inclusive) is \u001294 9 \u0013 − \u001283 9 \u0013 = 734,983,717,468. (e) How many ways are there to divvy up the gold so that Redbeard gets somewhere between 0 and 10 (inclusive) pieces of gold and Blackbeard gets somewhere between 10 and 20 (inclusive) pieces of gold? There are \u001290 + 10 −1 10 −1 \u0013 = \u001299 9 \u0013 ways to divvy up the gold so that Blackbeard gets at least 10 pieces. We will use the version 1 of the Principle of Inclusion–Exclusion (Theorem refPIE1) to determine how many of these ways result in Redbeard getting at most 10 pieces and Blackbeard getting at most 20 pieces. • There are \u000088 9 \u0001 ways to distribute the gold so that Blackbeard gets at least 10 pieces and Redbeard gets more than 10 (at least 11) pieces. • There are \u000088 9 \u0001 ways to distribute the gold so that Blackbeard gets more than 20 (at least 21) pieces. • There are \u000077 9 \u0001 ways to distribute the gold so that Blackbeard gets more than 20 pieces and Redbeard gets more than 10 pieces. By the Principle of Inclusion–Exclusion, the number of valid distributions is \u001299 9 \u0013 −2 \u001288 9 \u0013 + \u001277 9 \u0013 = 749,652,784,639. Thus, there are 749,652,784,639 ways to divvy up the gold so that Redbeard gets at most 10 pieces and Blackbeard gets between 10 and 20 (inclusive) pieces.", "output": "Think about what proof technique would work best here: direct proof, contrapositive, or contradiction?", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

Here, |A1|+|A2| counts all elements in A1 and A2, but elements in A1 ∩A2 are counted twice. To correct this, we subtract |A1 ∩A2|. We now extend this idea. Consider three finite sets A1, A2, and A3. Then: |A1 ∪A2 ∪A3|= |A1|+|A2|+|A3|−|A1 ∩A2|−|A1 ∩A3|−|A2 ∩A3|+|A1 ∩A2 ∩A3|. As before, terms like |A1 ∩A2| are subtracted to account for double-counting, and |A1 ∩ A2 ∩A3| is added to correct over-subtraction of elements common to all three sets. We now state and prove the general case. 236\n\n Theorem 37.2.1 (Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion). Let m ∈Z+, S be a finite set, and A1, A2, . . . , Am ⊆S. Then: |A1 ∪A2 ∪· · · ∪Am|= m X i=1 |Ai|− X 1≤i<j≤m |Ai ∩Aj|+ X 1≤i<j<k≤m |Ai ∩Aj ∩Ak| −· · · + (−1)m+1 \f\f\f\f m \\ i=1 Ai \f\f\f\f. Equivalently: |A1 ∪A2 ∪· · · ∪Am|= X ∅̸=X⊆[m] (−1)|X|+1 \f\f\f\f \\ i∈X Ai \f\f\f\f. Proof. Define the characteristic function fi : S →{0, 1} by: fi(x) = ( 1 if x ∈Ai, 0 if x /∈Ai. Now define F : S →{0, 1} by: F(x) = 1 − m Y i=1 (1 −fi(x)). This function is 1 if x ∈Sm i=1 Ai and 0 otherwise. Therefore: X x∈S F(x) = |A1 ∪A2 ∪· · · ∪Am|. Expanding F(x) using the Binomial Theorem, we have: F(x) = 1 − m Y i=1 (1 −fi(x)) = X ∅̸=X⊆[m] (−1)|X|+1 Y i∈X fi(x). By summing over x ∈S, we obtain: X x∈S F(x) = X ∅̸=X⊆[m] (−1)|X|+1 \f\f\f\f \\ i∈X Ai \f\f\f\f. Equating this with |A1 ∪A2 ∪· · · ∪Am|, we derive the desired result. 237\n\n Example 37.2.2.

Appendix 242\n\n A. Constructing the Naturals In this course, we take the natural numbers for granted, but it is possible to construct them formally inside modern set theory. The most commonly used foundation is Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC). A.1. The ZFC Axioms (Informal List) ZFC is a collection of axioms that govern the behavior of sets. • Extensionality: Two sets are equal if and only if they have the same elements. • Empty Set: There exists a set, denoted ∅, with no elements. • Pairing: For any sets a and b, there exists a set {a, b}. • Union: For any set A, there exists a set S A whose elements are exactly those belonging to members of A. • Power Set: For any set A, there exists a set P(A) whose elements are all subsets of A. • Specification (Subset Axiom Scheme): Given any set A and any property P(x) (expressible in the language of set theory), there exists a set {x ∈A | P(x)}. • Replacement (Axiom Scheme): The image of any set under any definable function is itself a set. • Infinity: There exists an inductive set I such that ∅∈I and for all x ∈I, the successor x ∪{x} is also in I. • Foundation (Regularity): Every non-empty set A contains an element a that is disjoint from A (i.e., a ∩A = ∅). • Choice: For any collection of nonempty sets, there is a function that chooses one element from each set. The Axiom of Infinity is crucial here: it guarantees the existence of at least one inductive set from which we can build the natural numbers. (The Axiom of Choice is not needed for N itself, but is included in ZFC for broader mathematics.) 243\n\n A.2. The Successor Function Define the successor of a set x as S(x) := x ∪{x}. This ensures x ∈S(x) and x ⊊S(x), mimicking the intuitive “add one” operation. A.3. Defining N The Axiom of Infinity provides an inductive set I. However, I may contain extra elements. To obtain the smallest inductive set, we apply the Axiom of Specification to define: N := \\ {X ⊆I : ∅∈X and ∀x ∈X, S(x) ∈X}. This set N is the intersection of all inductive subsets of I. It is itself inductive and is the unique minimal inductive set. A.4. The von Neumann Ordinals With this construction, each natural number is identified with a specific set: 0 := ∅, 1 := S(0) = {∅} = {0}, 2 := S(1) = {∅, {∅}} = {0, 1}, 3 := S(2) = {0, 1, 2}, ... n := {0, 1, 2, . . . , n −1}. In other words, each n is the set of all smaller natural numbers. This construction also defines the usual ordering: m < n if and only if m ∈n. A.5. Arithmetic on N Addition and multiplication can be defined recursively using the successor function. For example, addition is defined by: m + 0 := m, m + S(n) := S(m + n). 244\n\n From these definitions, all familiar properties of arithmetic (commutativity, associativity, distributivity, etc.) can be derived using induction. This development is rigorous but lengthy, and is typically studied in more advanced logic or set theory courses. A.6. Induction as a Theorem Since N is defined as the smallest inductive set, the Principle of Mathematical Induction follows as a theorem in ZFC. Theorem A.6.1 (Principle of Mathematical Induction). Let X ⊆N. If: 1. 0 ∈X, and 2. ∀n ∈N, (n ∈X =⇒S(n) ∈X), then X = N. Proof Sketch. The assumptions say that X is inductive. Since N is defined as the intersection of all inductive sets contained in some inductive I, it follows that N ⊆X. The reverse inclusion X ⊆N is immediate from the definition of X as a subset of N. Hence X = N. This theorem directly implies the familiar induction principle for statements: if a property P(n) holds for n = 0 and P(n) implies P(n + 1) for all n, then P(n) holds for all n ∈N (by considering the set X = {n ∈N | P(n) is true}). 245", "output": "Consider using mathematical induction.

Assume for the sake of contradiction that there exist m, n ∈Z with m2 = 3n+2. By the Division Algorithm, we can uniquely write m = 3q + r for some q ∈Z and r ∈{0, 1, 2}. We consider the possible values of r: • Case 1: r = 0. Then m = 3q, so m2 = 9q2 = 3(3q2). Thus m2 is divisible by 3, so its remainder upon division by 3 is 0. But 3n + 2 has remainder 2, so equality is impossible. • Case 2: r = 1. Then m = 3q + 1, so m2 = (3q + 1)2 = 9q2 + 6q + 1 = 3(3q2 + 2q) + 1. Thus m2 has remainder 1 upon division by 3, which again cannot equal 3n + 2. • Case 3: r = 2. Then m = 3q + 2, so m2 = (3q + 2)2 = 9q2 + 12q + 4 = 3(3q2 + 4q + 1) + 1.

Since 3k2 −1 ∈Z, we have that n2 −1 has a remainder of 2 when divided by 3, and hence is not divisible by 3. Thus, 3 | n2 −1 =⇒3 ∤n. • (⇐): Assume 3 ∤n. By the division algorithm write n = 3q + r with q ∈Z and r ∈{0, 1, 2}. Since 3 ∤n we must have r ∈{1, 2}. 264\n\n ▶If r = 1, then n = 3q + 1 and n2 −1 = (3q + 1)2 −1 = 9q2 + 6q = 3(3q2 + 2q). Since 3q2 + 2q ∈Z, 3 | n2 −1. ▶If r = 2, then n = 3q + 2 and n2 −1 = (3q + 2)2 −1 = 9q2 + 12q + 3 = 3(3q2 + 4q + 1). 3q2 + 4q + 1 ∈Z, so again 3 | n2 −1. In both cases we have 3 | n2 −1. Thus, 3 ∤n =⇒3 | n2 −1. Combining the two implications proves the desired equivalence. Proof 2 (Exhaustive Case Analysis). By the division algorithm, for any n ∈Z there exist unique integers q and r with 0 ≤r ≤2 such that n = 3q +r. We consider the three cases. • Case r = 0. Then n = 3q and n2 −1 = (3q)2 −1 = 9q2 −1 = 3(3q2) −1 = 3(3q2 −1) + 2, so 3 ∤n2 −1. Hence in this case 3 ∤n2 −1 and 3 | n. • Case r = 1. Then n = 3q + 1 and n2 −1 = (3q + 1)2 −1 = 9q2 + 6q = 3(3q2 + 2q), so 3 | n2 −1 and 3 ∤n. • Case r = 2. Then n = 3q + 2 and n2 −1 = (3q + 2)2 −1 = 9q2 + 12q + 3 = 3(3q2 + 4q + 1), so 3 | n2 −1 and 3 ∤n. Thus 3 | n2 −1 exactly in the cases r = 1, 2, i.e. precisely when 3 ∤n, proving the equivalence.", "output": "Think about what proof technique would work best here: direct proof, contrapositive, or contradiction?", "source_file": "LectureNotes-Fall2025.pdf"}

Let x, y ∈R such that x ̸= y. 265\n\n (⇒) Suppose that (x + 1)2 = (y + 1)2. Taking square roots of both sides, we get: |x + 1|= |y + 1|. This equation implies two possibilities: x + 1 = y + 1 or x + 1 = −(y + 1). ▶In the first case, x + 1 = y + 1, subtracting 1 from both sides yields x = y, which contradicts our assumption that x ̸= y. Therefore, this case cannot occur. ▶In the second case, x + 1 = −(y + 1). Simplifying this gives: x + 1 = −y −1 which can be rearranged to: x + y = −2 Hence, if (x + 1)2 = (y + 1)2, then x + y = −2, as required. (⇐) Now, suppose that x + y = −2. We can rearrange this as: x + 1 = −y −1 Squaring both sides of this equation, we obtain: (x + 1)2 = (−y −1)2 Since squaring removes the negative sign, we have: (x + 1)2 = (y + 1)2 which is the desired result.

By the definition of the Cartesian product, this implies a ∈B and b ∈A. Since a ∈A and b ∈B were arbitrary choices, we conclude that A ⊆B and B ⊆A. Therefore, by double containment, A = B, as required. (⇐) Suppose that A = ∅, B = ∅, or A = B. If A = ∅, then A × B = B × A = ∅, as desired. Similarly, if B = ∅, the equality holds trivially.

Since x ∈A ∪B, it must be that x ∈A or x ∈B. Suppose x ∈A. Since x /∈A∩B and x ∈A, it must be that x /∈B (otherwise x would be in A ∩B). Thus, x ∈A ∖B. Similarly, if x ∈B, since x /∈A ∩B, it must be that x /∈A. Thus, x ∈B ∖A. Therefore, x ∈(A ∖B) ∪(B ∖A). This shows that (A ∪B) ∖(A ∩B) ⊆ (A ∖B) ∪(B ∖A). (⊇) Let x ∈(A∖B)∪(B∖A). By the definition of union, x ∈A∖B or x ∈B∖A. If x ∈A ∖B, then x ∈A and x /∈B. Hence, x ∈A ∪B and x /∈A ∩B because x /∈B. Therefore, x ∈(A ∪B) ∖(A ∩B). Similarly, if x ∈B∖A, then x ∈B and x /∈A. Thus, x ∈A∪B and x /∈A∩B because x /∈A. Therefore, x ∈(A ∪B) ∖(A ∩B). Therefore, (A ∖B) ∪(B ∖A) ⊆(A ∪B) ∖(A ∩B). By double containment, (A ∪B) ∖(A ∩B) = (A ∖B) ∪(B ∖A), as desired. (b) Prove that A△B = ∅if and only if A = B. Proof. (⇒) Suppose A△B = ∅. We want to show that A = B. Take any element a ∈A. If a /∈B, then a ∈A ∖B by the definition of set difference. Since A△B = (A ∪B) ∖(A ∩B), and we have A△B = ∅, it follows that a /∈A△B. This contradicts our assumption that a ∈A ∖B if a /∈B. Therefore, a ∈B. Similarly, take any element b ∈B. If b /∈A, then b ∈B ∖A. Again, since A△B = ∅, b /∈A△B, which contradicts the assumption that b ∈B ∖A. Thus, b ∈A. Therefore, A ⊆B and B ⊆A, which implies A = B. (⇐) Suppose A = B. Then A ∖B = ∅and B ∖A = ∅by the definition of set difference. Hence, from part (a), we have A△B = (A ∖B) ∪(B ∖A) = ∅∪∅= ∅. Thus, A△B = ∅, as desired.

{"instruction": "Give me a hint for solving the following problem.", "input": "2 Prove that 3√ 3 must be irrational. Proof. To prove that 3√ 3 is irrational, it suffices to show that 3√ 3 ̸= m n for all m, n ∈Z+. Define the predicate P(n) on n ∈Z+ by P(n) := ∀m ∈Z+, \u0010 3√ 3 ̸= m n \u0011 . Our goal is to show ∀n ∈Z+, P(n) holds. Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists n ∈Z+ such that ¬P(n) holds. By the Well-Ordering Property choose the least such n. Since ¬P(n) holds, there exists m ∈Z+ with 3√ 3 = m n . Fix such an m. Cubing both sides gives 3n3 = m3. Hence 3 divides m3. Consider the integer m3 −m = m(m2 −1) = m(m −1)(m + 1). 282\n\n The three integers m −1, m, m + 1 are consecutive, so one of them is a multiple of 3. Therefore the product m(m −1)(m + 1) is a multiple of 3, and hence 3 divides m3 −m. Since 3 divides m3 as well, it follows that 3 divides the difference m = m3 −(m3 −m), so 3 divides m. Thus we may write m = 3m′ for some m′ ∈Z+. Substituting back into 3n3 = m3 yields 3n3 = (3m′)3 = 27(m′)3 =⇒ n3 = 9(m′)3. Therefore 3 divides n3, and by the same argument applied to n we conclude 3 divides n. Write n = 3n′ for some n′ ∈Z+. Since n′ = n 3 < n, we have produced a strictly smaller denominator. Moreover, 3√ 3 = m n = 3m′ 3n′ = m′ n′ , so ¬P(n′) holds, contradicting the minimality of n. Thus our assumption was false, and P(n) holds for all n ∈Z+.

Expanding by the definition of f and equality of ordered pairs: 3x1 + 4y1 = 3x2 + 4y2 2x1 + y1 = 2x2 + y2 Rearranging these equations: 3(x1 −x2) = 4(y2 −y1) 2(x1 −x2) = y2 −y1 Substituting the expression for y2 −y1 from the second into equation into the first equation: 3(x1 −x2) = 8(x1 −x2) =⇒5(x1 −x2) = 0 =⇒x1 = x2, so the x-coordinates are the same.

We consider three cases: ▶Case 1: If a1 = a2 = 0, then j(a1, b1) = j(a2, b2) implies b1 = b2, so (a1, b1) = (a2, b2), as desired. ▶Case 2: If a1 > 0 and a2 > 0, then j(a1, b1) = j(a2, b2) implies −2a1−1(2b1 + 1) = −2a2−1(2b2 + 1). By the uniqueness of the power of 2 and odd number factorization, we have a1 −1 = a2 −1 and 2b1 + 1 = 2b2 + 1. From this, we conclude a1 = a2 and b1 = b2.

We will show that g is the inverse of f. • Well-Definedness: Since x ̸= 4 for all x ∈R ∖{4}, the expression 2x −5 4 −x is defined. If x1 = x2, then clearly 2x1 −5 4 −x1 = 2x2 −5 4 −x2 , so g(x1) = g(x2). To check that g(x) ∈R ∖{−2}, we verify that g(x) ̸= −2 for all x ∈R ∖{4}: g(x) = −2 ⇐⇒ 2x −5 4 −x = −2 ⇐⇒ 2x −5 = 2x + 8 ⇐⇒ −5 = 8, a contradiction.

Assume A and B are non-empty sets and f : A →B is a function. (⇒) Let g : B →A be a left inverse of f. Then g◦f = IdA by definition of a left inverse. To see that f is injective, let a1, a2 ∈A such that f(a1) = f(a2). Since these values are equal, and elements of B, we must have g(f(a1)) = g(f(a2)). But then, by assumption g ◦f = IdA, so we have IdA(a1) = IdA(a2). Finally, by definition of the identity function, we get that a1 = a2, as desired. Therefore f is an injection. (⇐) Assume f is injective. Since A ̸= ∅, fix a value a0 ∈A. Note that since f is injective, if b ∈Im(f) then ∃! a ∈A such that f(a) = b. Define g : B →A as follows: g(b) = ( a if b ∈Im(f) ∧f(a) = b a0 if b /∈Im(f) From the observations that a is unique if it exists, we have that g is well-defined. Moreover, let a ∈A be arbitrary, and let b = f(a). Then (g ◦f)(a) = g(f(a)) = g(b) = a Hence, g ◦f = IdA, and we conclude that g is a left-inverse. 293\n\n 17.

(b) Reflivity/symmetry/transitivity follows from properties of equalities. • (R): |x|= |x|. • (S): |x|= |y|⇒|y|= |x|. • (T): |x|= |y| and |y|= |z| imply |x|= |z|. Equivalence classes. For n ∈N, [0]≃= {0}, [n] = {n, −n} for n ≥1. (c) • (R): 4x + 7x = 11x is divisible by 11. • (S): We know 11 | 11x+11y. If 11 | 4x+7y then 11 | (11x+11y)−(4x+7y). • (T): 11 | 4x + 7y and 11 | 4y + 7z, then 11 divides their sum: (4x + 7y) + (4y + 7z) = 4x + 7z + 11y Since 11 | 11y, we can demonstrate that 11 | 4x + 7z. Equivalence classes. This is the same relation as congruence modulo 11. There is one equivalence class for each of the 11 possible remainders. (d) • (R): x/x = 1 = 20. • (S): If x/y = 2k then y/x = 2−k and −k ∈Z. • (T): If x/y = 2k and y/z = 2ℓthen x/z = (x/y)(y/z) = 2k+ℓ. Equivalence classes. Each class is all numbers that differ by a power of 2: [x] .= = {2kx : k ∈Z }. To pick a simple representative for each class, write x = a b in lowest terms. Then divide out every factor of 2 from both a and b until they are both odd. The fraction you get (with its sign) is a canonical representative. For example, 12 5 and 3 20 are in the same class, since both reduce to the representative 3 5 after removing factors of 2.

Proof. Let (x, y) ∈N2 and let a ∈N be arbitrary. We want to show that [(x, y)]∼+ [(a, a)]∼= [(x, y)]∼. By definition, [(x, y)]∼+ [(a, a)]∼= [(x + a, y + a)]∼. It remains to show that [(x + a, y + a)]∼= [(x, y)]∼. To see this, observe that x + (y + a) = y + (x + a), so (x, y) ∼(x + a, y + a). Hence [(x, y)]∼= [(x + a, y + a)]∼, as desired. (b) Prove that for each [(a, b)]∼∈Z, the element [(b, a)]∼is its additive inverse. Proof. Let (a, b) ∈N2. We want to show that [(a, b)]∼+ [(b, a)]∼= [(0, 0)]∼. By definition, [(a, b)]∼+ [(b, a)]∼= [(a + b, b + a)]∼. Furthermore, (a + b) + 0 = 0 + (b + a), so (a + b, b + a) ∼(0, 0), and hence [(a + b, b + a)]∼= [(0, 0)]∼, as desired.

By definition, [(a, b)]∼· [(1, 0)]∼= [(a + 0, 0 + b)]∼= [(a, b)]∼, as desired. Therefore [(1, 0)]∼is the multiplicative identity. (d) Verify that addition and multiplication in Z are commutative. Proof. Let (a, b), (c, d) ∈N2. • Addition: From the commutativity of addition in N we have [(a, b)]∼+ [(c, d)]∼= [(a + c, b + d)]∼ = [(c + a, d + b)]∼ = [(c, d)]∼+ [(a, b)]∼. • Multiplication: From the commutativity of addition and multiplication in N we have [(a, b)]∼· [(c, d)]∼= [(ad + bc, ac + bd)]∼ = [(cb + da, ca + db)]∼ = [(c, d)]∼· [(a, b)]∼. Therefore, addition and multiplication are commutative in Z. (e) Prove that multiplication distributes over addition. Proof. Let (a, b), (c, d), (e, f) ∈N2. We want to show that [(a, b)]∼· ([(c, d)]∼+ [(e, f)]∼) = ([(a, b)]∼· [(c, d)]∼) + ([(a, b)]∼· [(e, f)]∼). By definition of addition and multiplication in Z, [(a, b)]∼· ([(c, d)]∼+ [(e, f)]∼) = [(a, b)]∼· [(c + e, d + f)]∼ = [(a(d + f) + b(c + e), a(c + e) + b(d + f))]∼.

The two results are equal, so multiplication distributes over addition. (f) Prove that Z has no zero divisors. That is, if [(a, b)]∼· [(c, d)]∼= [(0, 0)]∼then [(a, b)]∼= [(0, 0)]∼or [(c, d)]∼= [(0, 0)]∼. Proof. Let (a, b), (c, d) ∈N2 such that [(a, b)]∼· [(c, d)]∼= [(0, 0)]∼. By definition, [(a, b)]∼· [(c, d)]∼= [(ad + bc, ac + bd)]∼. Hence (ad + bc, ac + bd) ∼(0, 0), which means ad + bc + 0 = ac + bd + 0, or equivalently, ad + bc = ac + bd. Rearranging terms yields (a −b)(c −d) = 0. Since N has no zero divisors, either a = b or c = d. • If a = b, then [(a, b)]∼= [(0, 0)]∼; • if c = d, then [(c, d)]∼= [(0, 0)]∼.

Since a = 1 · a, we have a ⪯a. • (AS): Let a, b ∈Q+ such that a ⪯b and b ⪯a. This means there exist m, n ∈Z+ such that a = bm and b = an. Thus, a = bm and b = an =⇒a ≥b and b ≥a.

By the definition of a decimal expansion, we have x = ∞ X i=1 ai 10i = ∞ X i=1 bi 10i . Let M be the smallest positive integer such that aM ̸= bM. By the minimality of M, it follows immediately that ai = bi for all 1 ≤i < M. Subtracting the finite sum of these identical terms from both sides yields ∞ X i=M ai 10i = ∞ X i=M bi 10i . We now prove the remaining two properties. • Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that aM ̸= bM + 1. Since aM > bM by hypothesis, this implies aM ≥bM + 2.

Multiplying the first equation by m we have (ma)x1 + (mb)y1 = md1 Since md1 can be written as a linear combination of ma and mb, we have d2 | md1, by the corollary to B´ezout’s Lemma. From the second equation, we have that m | d2 so d2 = mk for some k ∈Z. Dividing through by m we get ax2 + by2 = k Again, by the corollary to B´ezout’s Lemma we have that d1 | k. Therefore k = d1ℓfor some ℓ∈Z and thus d2 = md1ℓ. Hence md1 | d2. Since md1 | d2 and d2 | md1, we have that |md1|= |d2|.

Proof. Let a, b ∈Z such that gcd(a, b) = 1. We first show that the only possibilities for the gcd(a + b, a −b) are 1 and 2. Let d ∈Z+ such that d | a + b and d | a −b. Then we have d | ((a + b) + (a −b)) = 2a and d | ((a + b) −(a −b)) = 2b. Since d is a common divisor of 2a and 2b, we have 313\n\n d | gcd(2a, 2b). Since gcd(ma, mb) = m · gcd(a, b) for all m ∈Z+, along with our assumption that gcd(a, b) = 1, we have that gcd(2a, 2b) = 2 · gcd(a, b) = 2. This implies that d | 2. Therefore the only possible values for d are 1 and 2. It remains to show that gcd(a + b, a −b) = 2 iff a ≡b (mod 2). • (⇒): By contraposition. Suppose a ̸≡b (mod 2). Then 2 ∤a −b by definition of congruence modulo 2. Then 2 cannot be a common divisor of a −b and a + b. Therefore gcd(a + b, a −b) ̸= 2, as desired. • (⇐): Suppose a ≡b (mod 2). Then 2 | a −b by definition of congruence modulo 2. Additionally, b ≡−b (mod 2) because 2 | (b + b), so a ≡−b (mod 2) as well, implying that 2 | a + b.

By definition, b | lcm[a, b], so |b|| lcm[a, b]. By the antisymmetry of divisibility on the natural numbers, we have lcm[a, b] = |b|. 2. Let m ∈Z+. Further, let L = lcm[a, b] and M = lcm[ma, mb].

Let n ∈Z+ with prime factorization n = k Y i=1 pni i = pn1 1 pn2 2 · · · pnk k . In the case that n = 1, we can express this as n = 20. (⇒): Suppose n is a perfect square. Then n = m2 for some m ∈Z+. Furthermore, since m | n, we know that m can be expressed as m = k Y i=1 pmi i where 0 ≤mi ≤ni for each 1 ≤i ≤k. Then k Y i=1 pni i = n = m2 = k Y i=1 p2mi i . By uniqueness of prime factorizations, we must have ni = 2mi for each 1 ≤ i ≤k. Hence each ni is even, as desired. (⇐): Suppose each exponent ni is even. Then, for each 1 ≤i ≤k, ni = 2mi for some mi ∈Z+. Let m = k Y i=1 pmi i Then m2 = n, so n is a perfect square. (b) Prove that if a and b are coprime positive integers and their product is a perfect square, then a and b are themselves perfect squares. Proof Sketch. Let a, b ∈Z+ such that ab = m2 for some m ∈Z+. For any prime p appearing in the factorization of m2, p cannot appear in both a and b, due to coprimality. Since the exponents of the factorization of ab are all even, by part (a), the exponents of p in the factorizations of either a or b must also be even. Thus, by part (a), both a and b are perfect squares. (c) Prove that if a and b are positive integers and ab is a perfect square, then a = dm2 and b = dn2 where d = gcd(a, b), for some coprime integers m and n. Proof. Let d = gcd(a, b) and write a = da1 and b = db1 for a1, b1 ∈Z+. We know, from a previous theorem, that gcd(a1, b1) = 1. Since ab = (da1)(db1) = d2a1b1 is a perfect square, and d2 is a perfect square, it follows that a1b1 must also be a perfect square. Since gcd(a1, b1) = 1, we can apply part (b) to conclude that a1 and b1 are themselves perfect squares. So, a1 = m2 and b1 = n2 for some coprime integers m, n. Substituting back, we get a = da1 = dm2 and b = db1 = dn2. 316\n\n (d) Reprove the irrationality of √ 2 in the following way: • Assume for the sake of contradiction that √ 2 = a b where a, b ∈Z+ are coprime. Use part (a) to arrive at a contradiction. Proof. Assume √ 2 = a b with a, b ∈Z+ coprime. Then a2 = 2b2. By part (a), the exponent of 2 in the prime factorization of both a2 and b2 must be even. However, a2 = 2b2 and the uniqueness of prime factorizations, implies that the exponent of 2 in a2 is one more than the exponent of 2 in b2, making the exponent of 2 in a2 odd.

A sequence of 10 is possible, as illustrated below: {x1, x2}, {x1, x3}, {x1, x4}, {x1, x5}, {x2, x3}, {x2, x4}, {x2, x5}, {x3, x4}, {x3, x5}, {x4, x5} but any sequence of 11 must include a repeat, due to the pigeonhole principle. 338", "output": "Is this a permutation or combination problem?

Let x1, x2, . . . , x13 ∈R, and for each i define the fractional part Frac(xi) := xi −⌊xi⌋∈[0, 1). Since there are 13 numbers but only 12 subintervals, the pigeonhole principle guarantees that there exist i ̸= j such that Frac(xi) and Frac(xj) lie in the same subinterval. Without loss of generality, assume Frac(xi) ≥Frac(xj). Then 0 ≤Frac(xi) −Frac(xj) < 1 12. Observe that xi −xj = (⌊xi⌋−⌊xj⌋) + (Frac(xi) −Frac(xj)). 339\n\n It follows that 0 ≤(xi −xj) −(⌊xi⌋−⌊xj⌋) < 1 12, which is equivalent to ⌊xi⌋−⌊xj⌋≤xi −xj < ⌊xi⌋−⌊xj⌋+ 1 12. Since ⌊xi⌋−⌊xj⌋∈Z, this shows that the difference xi−xj is within 1 12 of an integer.", "output": "Start by carefully identifying what you're given and what you need to show.

Prove that there must exist x, y ∈T such that x and y are coprime. Proof. Let S = [2n] = {1, 2, . . . , 2n} and let T ⊆S with |T|= n + 1. Partition S into n subsets of size 2 as follows: {1, 2}, {3, 4}, . . . , {2n −1, 2n}. Since T has n + 1 elements but there are only n subsets in the partition, the pigeonhole principle guarantees that there exists at least one subset in the partition containing at least two distinct elements of T. Let x and y be two such elements in the same subset. Then there exists k ∈[n] such that {x, y} ⊆{2k −1, 2k}. Since x ̸= y, without loss of generality, we may assume x = 2k −1 and y = 2k. Since consecutive integers are always coprime, we conclude that x and y are coprime. 31.
